# Markdown
Markdown is amazing and such an awesome way to format the text you write.

I am using most of the features from it where appropriate. However in my GitHub repositories I like to mix in a little HTML mostly for cantering things like headings, images and images because I have a thing for centred content for some reason. And with macros adding these HTML blocks is as fast as adding a markdown header for me.

## Tips
- you can use relative paths in markdown links
- don't add extra space after heading as it is unnecessary
