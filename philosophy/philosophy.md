# Philosophy
The study of existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Or well, everything.

Being able to entertain new thoughts and hypothesis and try and ground them in the basis of our perception of the world is interesting.

In any way, it is an interesting subject I don't know much about.

## Notes
- Stoicism helped me build the ability to care about the things in my power to change, and not stress about things that aren't.
