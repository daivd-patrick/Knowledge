# Philosophy

The study of existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. Or well, everything.

Being able to entertain new thoughts and hypothesis and try and ground them in the basis of our perception of the world is interesting.
  
In any way, it is an interesting subject I don't know much about.
