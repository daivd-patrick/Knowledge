# Fitness
Is something I really lack in my life.

I tried exercising occasionally at home but never really followed through with it. 

I am currently trying to limit my time being stationary by exercising either at home and occasionally at the gym.  

I also try to move a lot. Fortunately, since I live in Netherlands and everyone uses bikes here, that is a given.
