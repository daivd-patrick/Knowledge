# Fitness
I start every morning by either going to the gym, playing tennis or running for 90 minutes.

I am also trying to limit my time being stationary and never sitting in one place for too long.

## Notes
- Exercise helps make better use of the foods you are eating and produces the hormones you need to think clearly.
