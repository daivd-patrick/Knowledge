# My file system
I have a very intricate system where I put files according to their purpose and context thus I always know where to find them. And I access everything from Alfred.

##  \~/play
I have a folder `~/play` where I clone different projects. I then filter contents of it with [this workfow](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kme10u2pycwcx1l/directory%20watches.alfredworkflow?dl=1).

## \~/projects
I also have a `~projects` folder where I keep all the ongoing projects I am working on

## \~/oss
Inside this folder I keep all the things I have open sourced and that are on GitHub sorted by the organisation. Currently it just has two folders there (my name and LA org).

And inside I sort the projects according to their purpose too :

## Go code
I keep all my Go projects inside my GOPATH.

## \~/Documents
I use Documents to store things like books, research papers, uni work, various app related things and files, audio books and more. Here is how my Documents folder looks like :

I use a custom icon for Documents folder just so it's easy to distinguish them from the rest using my [folder search workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-folder-search).

And finally, since I use Karabiner and it gives me such a freedom of infinite binding of keys. I dedicate my `4` key for quickly opening various folders in Alfred file viewer.
