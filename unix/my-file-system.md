# My file system
I have an intricate system where I put files according to their purpose and context thus I always know where to find them. And I access everything from Alfred.

## ~/Desktop
My Desktop is nearly always empty. It acts as a kind of `temp` folder where every file that is put there needs to be acted upon and either moved to some other place in my system or deleted.

I use [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/clean-folders#readme) to completely trash everything inside `~/Desktop` with one hotkey. I also use [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/augmentations/Directory%20watches.alfredworkflow?raw=true) to quickly scan the contents of `~/Desktop` from Alfred.

## ~/Downloads
I try to keep this folder like `Desktop` always empty. This is the folder where I download things to from the browser as well as other places.

I use [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/augmentations/Recent%20Downloads.alfredworkflow?raw=true) to scan through contents of it from Alfred.

## ~/src
Everything that is code is put into this folder.

```Bash
~/src
❯ exa
Xcode		bots		curated		games		languages	ml		personal	test
alfred		clones		forks		ideas		learn		orgs		practice	web
```

## ~/src/clones
I often love checking out various GitHub repos. Everything that I clone, I clone into this folder. I [use km macro](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/insta-cloning-ff5f38eb1d32) that will clone the repo that is currently open in my Safari tab. It will put the repo in `~/src/clones` and then open it in VS Code. I also have similar macros that will only clone the repo or clone the repo and open it in Sublime Text.

I then filter contents of the folder with [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/augmentations/Directory%20watches.alfredworkflow?raw=true).

## ~/src/forks
Forked by me repos that I want to keep working on, are kept inside `forks` folder.

## ~/src/orgs
Inside this folder I keep all the things that are open source on GitHub sorted by organization. In my case it's only [learn-anything](https://github.com/learn-anything/):

```Bash
~/src/orgs
❯ exa
learn-anything
```

## ~/go/src/github.com/nikitavoloboev
I keep all my Go projects inside my GOPATH.

## ~/src/test
Inside this folder I have a bunch of language specific folders that usually just have one file inside them with the extension of that language. Here is how that folder looks for me:

```Bash
~/src/test
❯ exa
bash-test	c-test		clojure-test	go-test		haskell-test	js-test		lisp-test	python-test	web-test
```

I then have KM macros to quickly open these files:

## ~/src/ideas
Most of my projects I start, start out in this folder. If something works out and I like the idea and want to develop it further, I move the project away from `ideas`.

## ~/src/Xcode
Contains all my Swift iOS and macOS projects. It is further divided into macOS, iOS and playgrounds folders.

## ~/src/learn
I use the folder to learn new technologies, languages and things. Perhaps I am completing some course or going through some book that has exercises. I put it there.

```Bash
~/src/learn
❯ exa
go-learn	graphics-learn	ml-learn	react-learn	stats-learn
```

## ~/src/alfred
All my Alfred workflows are placed there. And each one is symlinked either with [workflow install](https://gist.github.com/deanishe/35faae3e7f89f629a94e) or [Alfred CLI tool](https://godoc.org/github.com/jason0x43/go-alfred/alfred) for Go workflows.

```Bash
~/src/alfred
❯ exa
alfred-ask-create-share	alfred-awgo-test	alfred-inline-searches	alfred-my-mind		alfred-web-searches
alfred-awesome-lists	alfred-github		alfred-learn-anything	alfred-trello		small-workflows
```

## ~/src/curated
Keep all the GitHub [curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme) there where all edits to the `readme.md` files is automatically committed with [Hazel](../macOS/apps/hazel.md).

```bash
~/src/curated
❯ exa
alfred-workflows	courses			games			movies			quotes			slack-groups		websites
blogs			curated-lists		humans			newsletters		reddit			spectrum		youtube
books			documentaries		images			podcasts		reddit-multi		stack-exchange
cheat-sheets		find-work		ios-apps		privacy-respecting	research-papers		talks
chrome-extensions	firefox-extensions	macos-apps		programming-languages	safari-extensions	telegram
command-line-tooexa	forums			mindmaps		quora			series			tv-series
```

## ~/app
I put app specific files in there.

```Bash
~/app
❯ exa
focus		hammerspoon	km		paw		sublime		textual
```

## ~/Documents
I use Documents to store things like books, research papers, uni work, various app related things and files, audio books and more. Here is how my Documents folder looks like:

```Bash
~/Documents
❯ exa
Audio Books  Books  Design  History  LaTeX  Personal docs  Pixave  Podcasts  Uni  Watch
```
