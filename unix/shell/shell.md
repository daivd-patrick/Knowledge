# [Unix Shell](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Unix_shell)
## Variables
All active variables can be seen by running `env`.
- `$HOME` - Expands to the path of my home folder.
- `$PS1` - Variable that represents my command prompt line.
- `$PATH` - Special environment variable that contains the command path (list of system directories that the shell searches when trying to locate a command).

## Notes
- Scripts are run in subshells, and nothing is shared "upwards". That's the difference between running a script and sourcing one. A sourced (imported) script is run in your own script's namespace.
- In shell everything is a string.
- Children never touch parent enviroment. It can only if it runs as part of the current process (source, function, alias).
- Pipes are used to connect one process's output with another processâ€™s input.
