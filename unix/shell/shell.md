# Unix Shell
## Variables
- `$HOME` - expands to the path of my home folder.
- `$PS1` - the variable that represents my command prompt line.

## Notes
- In shell everything is a string.
- Children never touch parent enviroment. It can only if it runs as part of the current process (source, function, alias).
