# Focusing
Focusing on the things I need to be doing is often hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

## Flow
Getting in the _flow_ state is one of the most important things I try to focus on throughout the day.

I try to define a certain set of [rules](rules.md) and [processes](processes.md) that I like myself to follow for doing certain things.

For example, one of these _rules_ is that I need to be proactive with my email and action on every email I read. But there are [many other ones](rules.md) out there.

## Focusing on what's important
I keep a private Trello board where I outline things that I want to focus on in life and achieve.

I mark the projects and goals I want to focus on right now, and by pressing `Q` in Trello I will only see these cards on the board.

I use the same `Focus on cards` approach for all my [other Trello boards](../sharing/my-trello.md) too.

I assign due dates for all my goals I am striving to achieve and I find this goal centric approach to be incredibly useful as it lets me focus on making sure I do everything I need to achieve the goals I have set for myself. Making sure I limit the number of projects I am working on at any given time lets me actually deeply focus on them instead of being scattered around wondering if I am working on the right thing in the moment.

## Focus sessions
I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) to block many non work related websites for 100 minutes (front pages of Hacker News, Reddit, ..) every 2 hours.

I also have Focus trigger Do Not Disturb mode on Focusing. This way I get no notifications when I am working and I get 0 distractions.

The things I work on during this 100 min focus session is specified by an event in [Fantastical](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md). The events are simply names of projects on which I want to work on in that time. Here are the most common events I use and what I do during them:
- Inbox - I open [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) and work through the most prioritized tasks for `Today`.
- Code - I use [Bee](https://www.neat.io/bee/) app and work through GitHub issues in `Next` list.
- Ideas - I pick an idea I want to work on from [Trello](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) and make it.
- Learn - I choose a topic I want to learn from [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q) and learn it. Either by reading [books](https://trello.com/b/MOrnm2aN), [research papers](https://trello.com/b/EKl1Ie3q) or exploring [LA](../ideas/learn-anything.md).

At the end of the 100 min focus session, [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) shows up automatically and I say which projects I worked on in this 100 min period. The projects in Timing are a reflection of projects in my Focus Trello board.

I also use [modified EggTimer workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows#workflow-augmentations) to quickly set time estimates for tasks I am working on.

I focus fully on [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) I need to solve and spend 0 energy thinking about what I should be doing or whether I am spending my time wisely in the moment. Full focus on the task at hand. No multitasking. No distractions.

## Other things
- I don't listen to distracting music when trying to focus. Instead I use [Noizio](http://noiz.io), [Oak](https://www.oakmeditation.com) or have nothing playing at all.
- I always have water or tea nearby and keep myself hydrated. If I can't solve some problem or feel like I can't keep my focus, I take a walk outside or do some exercise.
- I try to work outside of home and move often. When that is not possible I emulate a working environment in some part of my home so my brain knows that if I am in this place, it is time to work and not do anything else.
- I don't use any external monitors. I found multiple monitors distracting as I can do everything fast from my computer already.
- I strive to support my [happiness](../life/happiness.md) by working on projects that I care about and looking after my [health](../health/health.md).
- I constantly refine [my workflow](../sharing/my-workflow.md) to be more efficient and better every day. I also maintain a set of [my own rules in life](rules.md) that I follow.

## Notes
- You can't manage projects. You can only manage actions related to projects.
