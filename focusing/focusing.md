# Focusing

Focusing on the things I need to be doing is often hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

## Flow

Getting in the _flow_ state is one of the most important things I try to focus on throughout the day.

I try to define a certain set of [rules](rules.md) and [processes](processes.md) that I like myself to follow for doing certain things.

For example, one of these _rules_ is that I need to be proactive with my email and action on every email I read. But there are [many other ones](rules.md) out there.

## Focusing on what's important

I keep a private Trello board where I outline things that I want to focus on in life and achieve.

I mark the projects and goals I want to focus on right now, and by pressing `Q` in Trello I only see these cards on the board.

I use the same `Focus on cards` approach for all my [other Trello boards](../sharing/my-trello.md) too.

I try to have a completely event driven workflow as I schedule events in my calendar and plan the next day or days ahead of me in context of my bigger and smaller goals.

I use [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md)'s recurring scheduled tasks as a way to remember to complete my day/week/monthly reviews & plans which I often do in the evenings of particular days.

I find this goal centric approach to be incredibly useful as it lets me focus on making sure I do everything I need to achieve the goals I have set for myself. Making sure I limit the number of projects I am working on at any given time lets me actually deeply focus on them instead of being scattered around wondering if I am working on the right thing in the moment.

## Focus sessions

I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) as a recurring [Pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which lets me work in sessions of 80 minutes with 10 min breaks by blocking [distracting websites](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/57340528a6dfb3eb498dce647ed6841f) and apps.

Only on breaks can I visit these websites. I also get 20 minutes of optional break time every 3 hours. And I can start 5 min breaks during my Focus sessions with a macro.

The things I work on are events I have set in [Fantastical](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md). The events can be meetings or projects I have set. Some common events include:

- 2Do (‚òëÔ∏è) - I open [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) and work through the most prioritized tasks for `Today` or `Starred`.
- Ideas (‚ú®) - I pick an idea from [Trello](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) and make it.
- OSS (üíª) - I work through 2Do tasks with `pr` tag or work on open issues/prs I have on GitHub.
- Learn (üìñ) - I learn a topic from one of the currently active topics on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q).

At the end of the 80 min focus session, [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) shows up automatically and I say which projects I worked on in this 80 min period.

The projects are a reflection of my Focus Trello board.

I limit apps that can send me notifications to only essential things and turn off all sounds on notifications I get.

I focus on [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) & limit any distractions.

## Other things

- I don't listen to distracting music & block out environment noise when focusing. Instead I use [Noizio](http://noiz.io) or [Dark Noise](https://darknoise.app) and listen to rain or similar sounds.
- I always have water or tea nearby and keep myself hydrated. If I can't solve some problem or feel like I can't keep my focus, I take a walk outside or do some exercise.
- I try to work outside of home and move often. When that is not possible I emulate a working environment in some part of my home so my brain knows that if I am in this place, it is time to work and not do anything else.
- I don't use any external monitors. I found multiple monitors distracting as I can do everything fast with my macbook already.
- I strive to support my [happiness](../life/happiness.md) by working on projects that I care about and looking after my [health](../health/health.md).
- I constantly refine [my workflow](../sharing/my-workflow.md) to be more efficient and better every day. I also maintain a set of [my own rules in life](rules.md) that I follow.

## Notes

- You can't manage projects. You can only manage actions related to projects.
- [Brains aren‚Äôt for holding info, they‚Äôre for thinking. So if you can empty your brain out by writing stuff onto a todo list, onto your calendar, etc, your brain will have more space for the high level stuff that‚Äôs a bit harder to get on paper. And if you wrote down ‚Äúdo thing‚Äù on the todo-list‚Ä¶ well you just have to do the thing afterwards. There‚Äôs nothing to think about or redigest if you write out the things in more detail](https://lobste.rs/s/0qlkm7/how_do_i_keep_multiple_projects_my_head)
