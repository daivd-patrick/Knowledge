# Focusing
Focusing on the things I need to be doing is often hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

## Flow
Getting in the _flow_ state is one of the most important things I try to focus on throughout the day. The _flow_ state is different for all people.

I try to define a certain set of [rules](rules.md) and [processes](processes.md) that I like myself to follow for doing certain things.

For example, one of these _rules_ can be that I need to be proactive with my email. And strive to reach inbox zero until the end of the day. But there are [many other ones](rules.md) out there.

## Focusing on what's important
I keep a private Trello board where I outline things that I want to focus on in life and achieve. I try to not work on long periods of time and predict things in advance for over three months and instead work in very short time frames whilst having some end goal(s) in mind of what I ultimately want to achieve. Here is how my __Focus__ Trello board looks:

I mark the cards I want to focus on right now in my life and then only see the cards I want to focus on right now on the board.

I use the same `Focus on cards` approach for all my [other Trello boards](../sharing/my-trello.md) too.

## Things that help me
- I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) to block a particular set of websites for 90 minutes (front pages of Hacker News, Reddit, ..) every 2 hours. I also have Focus trigger Do Not Disturb by calling [this CLI tool](https://github.com/sindresorhus/do-not-disturb-cli). This way I get no notifications when I am working and have 0 distractions.
- I don't listen to any music when working and instead use [Noizio](http://noiz.io/) and listen to sounds of wind, rain, train or fire.
- I try to work outside of home and move often. When that is not possible I emulate a working enviroment in some part of my home so my brain knows that if I am in this place, it is time to work and not do anything else.
- I always have water or tea nearby and keep myself hydrated. If I can't solve some problem or feel like I can't keep my focus, I take a walk outside or do some exercise.
- I don't use any external monitors. I found multiple monitors distracting as I can do everything really fast from my computer already.
- I live fully by my projects I assigned to work on this week. I then schedule the time and the projects I want to work on in [Fantastical](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md) and review the time I have spent after each Focus session (90 min) in [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md). I don't want to waste any mental energy deciding what I want to do as I am working on something and instead want to focus fully on [solving the problems](../research/solving-problems.md) I have in front of me.

## Notes
- You can't manage projects. You can only manage actions related to projects.
