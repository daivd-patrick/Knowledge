# Focusing
Focusing on the things I need to be doing is often hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

## Flow
Getting in the _flow_ state is one of the most important things I try to focus on throughout the day.

I try to define a certain set of [rules](rules.md) and [processes](processes.md) that I like myself to follow for doing certain things.

For example, one of these _rules_ can be that I need to be proactive with my email. And strive to reach inbox zero until the end of the day. But there are [many other ones](rules.md) out there.

## Focusing on what's important
I keep a private Trello board where I outline things that I want to focus on in life and achieve. I try to not work on long periods of time and predict things in advance for over three months and instead work in very short time frames whilst having some end goal(s) in mind of what I ultimately want to achieve. Here is how my __Focus__ Trello board looks:

I mark the cards I want to focus on right now in my life and then only see the cards I want to focus on right now on the board.

I use the same `Focus on cards` approach for all my [other Trello boards](../sharing/my-trello.md) too.

## Focus sessions
I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) to block many non work related websites for 90 minutes (front pages of Hacker News, Reddit, ..) every 2 hours.

I also have Focus trigger Do Not Disturb mode by calling [this CLI tool](https://github.com/sindresorhus/do-not-disturb-cli). This way I get no notifications when I am working and I get 0 distractions.

The things I work on during this 90 min focus session is specified by an event in [Fantastical](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md). The events are simply names of projects on which I want to work on in that time. Here are the most common events I use and what I do during them:
- GitHub - I use [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/index.html) app and work through GitHub issues in `Up Next` list.
- Inbox - I open [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) and work through the most priorotised tasks for `Today`.
- Books - I open [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com/) and read through the [book I set out to read](https://trello.com/b/MOrnm2aN).
- Research papers - I open [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com/) and read through the [research paper I set out to read](https://trello.com/b/EKl1Ie3q).
- Learn - I choose a topic I want to learn from [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q) and learn it. Usually I start with wiki and resources from [LA](../projects/learn-anything.md).

At the end of the 90 min focus session, [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) shows up automtically and I say which projects I worked on in this 90 min period. The projects in Timing are a reflection of projects in my Focus Trello board.

I focus fully on [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) I need to solve and spend 0 energy thinking about what I should be doing or whether I am spending my time wisely in the moment. Full focus on the task at hand. No multitasking. No distractions.

## Other things
- I don't listen to any music when working and instead use [Noizio](http://noiz.io/) and listen to sounds of wind, rain, train or fire.
- I always have water or tea nearby and keep myself hydrated. If I can't solve some problem or feel like I can't keep my focus, I take a walk outside or do some exercise.
- I try to work outside of home and move often. When that is not possible I emulate a working enviroment in some part of my home so my brain knows that if I am in this place, it is time to work and not do anything else.
- I don't use any external monitors. I found multiple monitors distracting as I can do everything really fast from my computer already.
- I strive to support my [happiness](../life/happiness.md) by working on projects that I care about and looking after my [health](../health/health.md).
- I constantly refine [my workflow](../sharing/my-workflow.md) to be more efficient and better every day. I also maintain a set of [my own rules in life](rules.md) that I follow.

## Notes
- You can't manage projects. You can only manage actions related to projects.
