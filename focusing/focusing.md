# Focusing

I define a set of [rules](rules.md), [processes](processes.md) & [goals](goals.md) for myself to follow. They all act as a framework for how I lead my life and [keep my focus](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html).

## Focusing on what's important

I use [2Do](../macOS/apps/2do.md) as my general task manager. [Trello](../sharing/my-trello.md) as a way to manage projects and track which ideas & things I am learning now. I love that Trello allows focusing in on cards so I can only see the cards I am working on now and nothing else.

I also use 2Do to schedule a weekly task to reflect on the week passed & plan ahead.

I [schedule events](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md) in my calendar and plan the day/week in context of my tasks & priorities.

I try to limit the scope and number of projects I am working on at any given time to a minimum and give all my mental energy into completing each project to the best of quality.

I [use & build tools](../sharing/my-workflow.md) to make the process of completing my tasks as smooth as it can be.

I focus on [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) & limit distractions (only essential notifications setup). I follow [rules](rules.md#focus) to maintain my focus throughout the day.

I support my [happiness](../life/happiness.md) by working on projects that I care about and looking after my [health](../health/health.md).

## Notes

- You can't manage projects. You can only manage actions related to projects.
- [Brains aren’t for holding info, they’re for thinking. So if you can empty your brain out by writing stuff onto a todo list, onto your calendar, etc, your brain will have more space for the high level stuff that’s a bit harder to get on paper. And if you wrote down “do thing” on the todo-list… well you just have to do the thing afterwards. There’s nothing to think about or redigest if you write out the things in more detail](https://lobste.rs/s/0qlkm7/how_do_i_keep_multiple_projects_my_head)
