# Routine
Repeat things often enough and it becomes a routine. It's useful to be mindful and know what bad habits and routines you possess and break out of them.

I hope to cultivate and make many healthy routines and habits throughout my life. Here is a start. It simply states thing I should ideally follow or do at any given time throughout the day/week.

### Morning
1. Brush teeth and moisturise face.
2. Start working on the first event from my Calendar. Focus.

### Evening
1. Brush teeth, moisturise face and take shower.
2. Plan the day ahead in context of my Focus board estimates.
3. Go to sleep before 11 pm. Ideally.
