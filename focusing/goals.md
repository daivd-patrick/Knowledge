# Goals

The goals are quite broad now as I want to build LA to track the main things. Ideas & learning. Other goals are mostly rules I already have noted I want to focus my attention on.

## Build Learn Anything

Make the best tool for learning anything and sharing ideas. Release website, mobile app, API. Build up community.

## Healthy mind/body

Eat healthy and exercise daily. Play more tennis. Work ergonomically.

## Learn what matters. Solve problems.

Understand tech & tools I use deeply. Build, explore the tech. Solve problems & write about what I learned.

## Eradicate complexity/waste. Streamline actions.

I still feel frictions in writing, deploying code. Or more broadly translating ideas into code/solutions. Need better glue & tools.

Filter out wasteful news, information. No thoughtless actions. Focus on goals & todos.

## Go out of my comfort zone

Make screencasts/videos to educate. Write. Practice photography. Compose music. Design. Be inspired & improve myself.
