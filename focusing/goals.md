# Goals

## Build Learn Anything

Make the best tool for learning anything and sharing ideas. Release website, mobile app, API. Build up community.

## Healthy mind/body

Eat healthy and exercise daily. Work ergonomically. Follow [rules](rules.md).

## Learn what matters. Solve problems.

Understand tools I use deeply. Solve problems & write about what I learned.

## Eradicate complexity/waste. Streamline actions.

I still feel friction in writing code or making art. Need better processes & tools.

Filter out wasteful news, information. No thoughtless actions. Focus on goals & todos.

## Go out of my comfort zone

Make screencasts/videos to educate. Write. Practice photography. Compose music. Design. Be inspired & improve myself.

## Expand personal site

Lots of [inspiration](../design/design-inspiration.md). I want a personal space I can expand and build upon (experiment).

Blog, wiki, art, projects, photos. Look backs as nice newsletters + rich derived data (from GitHub/Twitter/..).
