# Goals

## Build Learn Anything

Make the best tool for learning anything and sharing ideas. Release website, mobile app, API. Build up community.

## Healthy mind/body

Eat healthy and exercise daily. Work ergonomically. Follow [rules](rules.md).

## Learn what matters. Solve problems.

Understand tools I use deeply. Solve problems & write about what I learned.

## Remove complexity/waste. Streamline processes.

Remove any friction I feel in life. Such as when writing code or making art. Build new tools & processes.

Filter out wasteful news, information. No thoughtless actions. Focus on goals & todos. No time wasted.

## Go out of my comfort zone. Meet people.

Make screencasts/videos to educate. Write. Practice photography. Compose music. Design. Share.

Be inspired & improve myself. Reach out to people I admire.

## Expand personal site

Lots of [inspiration](../design/design-inspiration.md). I want a personal space I can expand and build upon (experiment).

Blog, wiki, art, projects, photos. Look backs as nice newsletters + rich derived data (from GitHub/Twitter/..).

## Plan bigger. Save the planet.

Create amazing things. Focus on solving [real global problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKmQW_Nkfk8) like reversing climate change & [saving animals](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/iwujp5/humans_wiped_out_twothirds_of_the_worlds_wildlife/).

Earth is for everyone, not just humans. Be goal & [value](../business/startups/values.md) driven.
