# Processes

Some simple processes to follow when doing things.

## Learn

1. Find what I want/need to learn. Ideally in context of a problem I want to solve.
2. Read about it on wiki. Find the topic on [Learn Anything](../ideas/learn-anything.md) and learn from best resources for deeper knowledge.
3. Ask myself why it is the way it is. Ask myself what am I missing and what I don't understand (tackle each dependency one by one).
