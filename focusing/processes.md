# Processes
Some simple processes I should follow when doing things.

## Understand
1. Think it through.
2. Ask myself why it is the way it is.
3. Ask myself what am I missing and what I don't understand (tackle each dependency one by one).

## Learn something
1. Find what I want/need to learn. Ideally in context of a problem I want to solve.
2. Read about it on wiki. Find the topic on Learn Anything and learn from best resources for deeper knowledge.
