# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track my essential life habits. There are 12 of them & I want to complete them all for a perfect day.

I also keep top habits/[rules](rules.md) I try to follow through in life on display in my [Focus board](focusing.md).

## Morning routine

I use [Siri Shortcuts](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#shortcuts) for my Morning and Night routines. If I go through these routines, the two habits are automatically completed for me at the end of it.

## Other habits

`Activity rings` are autofilled for me from Apple health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is 750 calories with fixed 30 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Walk / Run / Cycle` is marked as done when I spent at least 50 minutes on a workout of either walking, running or cycling. I start my workouts from my watch and usually listen to audiobooks or podcasts in the process.

`Workout / Yoga` is marked as done when I spent at least 15 minutes on workouts via [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) (bodyweight exercises) or doing yoga with [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com).

`Water | Daily Mix | Plants` is marked as done when I drank only water/tea (no drink with added sugar). I also occasionally drink coffee. Fresh smoothies are allowed too. And I do one day a week scheduled [fasting](../health/nutrition/fasting.md).

`Plan | Adapt | Goal driven` is marked as done when I spent time moving towards the [goals I've set](../focusing/focusing.md). Adapting means reacting mindfully to new information. This also includes being open to change.

`No wasted time | Build ideas` is marked as done when I haven't spent any time unmindfully on things that bring no value to my life. Essentially it means doing things proactively rather than reactively and thus no time should be wasted no matter the distractions. Filter input, maximize output. I can check where my time is really being spent using tools like [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) or iOS Screen Time.

`Share | Write | Meet people` is marked as done when I have shared my thoughts/experiences freely and honestly. As well as sharing things I've learned by writing them down and sharing it. And finally broadening my life by meeting new people.

`Focus | One task at a time` is marked as done when I haven't derailed my focus throughout the day and did what I was supposed to do at ideally all points in time throughout the day. For `One task at a time`, [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) & [focusing](../focusing/focusing.md) goes over strategies I use to achieve this.

`Mindful, calm & happy` is currently the easiest habit for me to complete and I hope to keep it this way. It simply means a day spent being mindful of my thoughts & feelings and approaching any new thing with calmness and clarity. Whilst being happy with the fortune that is life.

`Good day | Timing & habits` is marked only when all the other 11 habits are marked as complete & when I am happy with how I spent my day.

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
