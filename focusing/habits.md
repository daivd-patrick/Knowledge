# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track my essential life habits.

The 6 habits are just a sample of more general [rules](rules.md) I want to follow in life. They are also displayed in my [Focus board](focusing.md).

## Habits described

`Sleep 8 hours` is autofilled through my health data.

`Wholefood | Food Mix` is marked as done when I drank only water/tea (no added sugar in anything). Occasional coffee is fine. And when I ate only wholefood foods (nuts/veggies/fruits). [Food mix](../health/nutrition/foods.md) is a set of foods I try to eat daily.

`Activity rings` is autofilled through my health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is 750 calories with fixed 30 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Cardio / Weights` is autofilled through my health data. It includes workout minutes from running/cycling & bodyweight/lifting workouts. Bodyweight/lifting is tracked with [Strong](https://strong.app) & [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) apps. It also includes yoga (tracked with [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com)).

`No wasted time | Build/Learn` is marked as done when I spent the day mindfully working towards my goals. Building ideas, learning or writing. The time I spent is tracked with tools like [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md).

`Focus | One task at a time` is marked as done when I didn't get distracted from the tasks I have assigned myself to do. [No multi tasking](../research/solving-problems.md).

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
