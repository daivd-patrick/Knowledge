# Habits
I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track any new habits I want to add to my life. If any of the habits get 30 consecutive repetitions, I mark the habit as `learned` and focus on new habits I want to add to my life.

## Learned habits
- No sugary drinks. (2017)
- Track all time in [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md). (2018)
- Take Vitamin B12 & D3 in morning. (2018 June)
