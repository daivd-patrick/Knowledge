# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track my essential life habits.

The 6 habits are just a sample of more general [rules](rules.md) I want to follow in life. They are also displayed in my [Focus board](focusing.md).

## Habits described

`Sleep 8 hours` is autofilled through my health data.

`Wholefood | Food Mix` is marked as done when I drank only water/tea (no added sugar in anything). Occasional coffee is fine. And when I ate only wholefood foods (nuts/veggies/fruits). [Food mix](../health/nutrition/foods.md) is a set of foods I try to eat daily.

`Activity rings` is autofilled through my health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is 750 calories with fixed 30 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Cardio / Weights` is autofilled through my health data. It includes workout minutes from running/cycling & bodyweight/lifting workouts. Bodyweight/lifting is tracked with [Strong](https://strong.app) & [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) apps. It also includes yoga (tracked with [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com)).

`No wasted time | Build ideas` is marked as done when I haven't spent any time unmindful & not focused on my goals & plans. Essentially it means doing things proactively rather than reactively and thus no time should be wasted no matter the distractions. Filter input, maximize output. I can check where my time was spent using tools like [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md).

`Focus | One task at a time` is marked as done when I haven't derailed my focus throughout the day and did what I was supposed to do at ideally all points in time throughout the day. [Solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) & [focusing](../focusing/focusing.md) goes over strategies I use to achieve this habit.

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
