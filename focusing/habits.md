# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track my essential life habits.

The 6 habits are an essential subset of more general [rules](rules.md) I want to follow in life. They are also displayed in my [Focus board](focusing.md).

## Habits described

`Sleep 8 hours` is autofilled through my health data. I get notification at `22:20` to remind me it's time for sleep & checking in habits I completed today.

`Wholefood | Nutri Boost` is marked as done when I drank only water/tea/coffee/smoothie (no sugar) & ate only wholefood foods (nuts/veggies/fruits). Nutri Boost is a [set of superfoods](../health/nutrition/foods.md) & [supplements](../health/nutrition/supplements.md) I try to eat daily.

`Activity rings` is autofilled through my health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is 750 calories with fixed 30 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Cardio / Weights` is autofilled through my health data. It includes workout minutes from running/cycling & bodyweight/lifting workouts. Bodyweight/lifting is tracked with [Strong](https://strong.app) & [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) apps. It also includes yoga (tracked with [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com)).

`No wasted time | Build/Learn` is marked as done when I spent the day mindfully working towards my goals. Building ideas, learning or writing. The time I spent is tracked with tools like [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md).

`Plan | Focus | One Task` is marked as done when I planned the day and followed through in working through the events. I also didn't get distracted from the tasks I have assigned myself to do & worked on [one task at a time](../research/solving-problems.md).

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
