# Habits

I use [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com) iOS app to track any new habits I want to add to my life. If any of the habits get 100 consecutive repetitions, I mark the habit as `learned` and focus on new habits I want to add to my life.

## Life habits

I also keep top habits/[rules](rules.md) I try to follow through in life on display in my [Focus board](focusing.md).

## Morning routine

I use [Siri Shortcuts](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#shortcuts) for my Morning and Night routines. If I go through these routines, the two habits are automatically completed for me at the end of it.

## Other habits

`Activity rings` are autofilled for me from Apple health data and is marked as done when all the ring goals are complete. My current calorie goal is 750 calories with fixed 30 min workout & 12H standing goals.

`Walk / Run / Cycle` is marked as done when I spent at least 50 minutes on a workout of either walking, running or cycling. I start my workouts from my watch and usually listen to audiobooks or podcasts in the process.

`Workout / Yoga` is marked as done when I spent this amount of minutes on workouts via [Streaks Workout](https://streaksworkout.com) which includes some bodyweight exercises I like doing or the time I spent doing yoga with [Down Dog](https://www.downdogapp.com).

`12H Ideas/Learn` is marked as done when I spent at least 12 hours of my day on activities I find most useful to my life, ideas & learning. Ideas is a rather broad term and includes all projects I care about completing. I track all time in [Timing](../macOS/apps/timing.md) which lets me see where I really spend my time & adjust accordingly.

`Water/tea | no sugar` is marked as done when I drank no drink that has sugar added to it. I try to drink only water & tea with occasional coffee.

`Daily mix | Plants | Fast 16` is marked as done when I ate [my daily mix](../health/nutrition/foods.md) (set of foods I try to eat at minimum every day). Plants part is marked as done when I followed through with my [whole food plant based diet](../health/nutrition/nutrition.md). And `Fast 16` means doing [intermittent fasting](../health/nutrition/fasting.md) so I can eat only in the 8 hour time slot each day. I also fast whole day on Friday.

`Focus | One task at a time` is pretty self explanatory. This is marked as done if I feel like I haven't derailed my focus throughout the day and did what I was supposed to do at ideally all points in time throughout the day. For `One task at a time`, [solving problems](../research/solving-problems.md) goes over strategies I use to achieve this.

`Event driven | Plan ahead` is mostly about setting events to achieve my goals (set in [Focus board](../focusing/focusing.md)) & going through with them. Event driven also means being open to change of plans in light of new insights.

`Mindful, calm & happy` is quite self explanatory. Fortunately this one is the easiest one for me to complete but I still like to keep it as a habit to remind myself of this rather simple but powerful habit.

`Good day | Timing & habits` is marked only when all the other 11 habits are marked as complete & when I am happy with how I spent my day. No useless news & distractions.

## Notes

- I think learning how to break habits is actually a very important meta skill and can serve you in life almost better than anything else.
