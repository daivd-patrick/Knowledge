Learned next.js more. Came back to NL. Worked on [Reflect](https://reflect.app/) for a bit. Started work on [epictools.dev](https://epictools.dev).

Loving [Один в каное](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VznuGjUSbOY) recently. ♥️

Learned some valuable relationship lessons these past few months too. Should express more love to my partner and stop doing any hurtful behavior immediately. Applies to any relationship but especially a romantic one. Trust is the most important thing you can gain in relationship and it's very easy to lose it.

Added some [Relationship Rules](../../focusing/rules.md#relationships) after what happened. Just need to be a better person than yesterday and learn from my mistakes.
