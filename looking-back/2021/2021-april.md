# 2021 April

Spent the month at my family's home in Spain. Little internet. Can't wait to go back to NL in May and start working at full speed.

Slowly removing bad habits from my life and ensuring I follow through my [top 6 habits I have set](../../focusing/habits.md).

The wiki grew by a lot this month but what's the point. No one is reading it. Need to focus better.

Also a bit burned out by things to do. ðŸ˜¿

I think I might just close off this wiki as it has no use for anyone but me it seems judging by [support I get on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev) and [elsewhere](https://gumroad.com/l/everything-i-know).
