# 2021 April

Spent the month at my family's home in Spain. Little internet. Can't wait to go back to NL in May and start working at full speed.

Slowly removing bad habits from my life and ensuring I follow through my [top 6 habits I have set](../../focusing/habits.md).

The wiki grew by a lot this month but what's the point. No one is reading it. Need to focus better.

Also a bit burned out by things to do. ðŸ˜¿

I think I might just close off this wiki as it has no use for anyone but me it seems judging by [support I get on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev) and [elsewhere](https://gumroad.com/l/everything-i-know).

I can't imagine how much harder it is for other people though so I can't complain really.

On less negative news, I am getting a better hang of how to use and utilize my wiki more. Added a lot of notes, links will soon be in LA.

Finishing up CSS course, releasing [EpicTools](https://epictools.dev) site with course content similar to what [Josh](https://twitter.com/JoshWComeau) has.

[1cP-LSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1cP-LSD) in nature alone is quite an experience though. Previously I only tripped at home or somewhere where people still kind of hanged around. I had some bad trips on LSD and I do dislike the length of the trip compared to other psyches but it's nice. I am 26 now and feel like I have not achieved anything in life yet, not for the lack of trying.

Too many words, May will be exciting. It's insane seeing how companies like Apple/Google/FB/.. grow nearly 100% at their scale. Talk about network effects and good product.
