Some time in Spain with family. More links/notes in wiki. Started to get more fascinated by history. Want to spend some time to get a better understanding of how humanity unfolded over all the years we know of. Starting with [history of Rome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ZXl-V4qwY), I want to read the [book about Genghis Khan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40718726-genghis-khan-and-the-making-of-the-modern-world), study the history of China (it seems to have a lot of wars over the years). Plus how the whole global financial system (or whatever that means) came about.

I also worked with [Memex](https://getmemex.com) briefly and it's an awesome tool, just need to [make it work for Safari first](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex/issues/1134) before I can invest more time in the project.

The goals for next month are to release first version of new LA. I talked about it before but for once, things are starting to fall into place regarding the tech stack and some design decisions go.
