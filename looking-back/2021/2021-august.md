Some time in Spain with family. More links/notes in wiki. Started to get more fascinated by history. Want to spend some time to get a better glimpse of how humanity unfolded over all the years we know of. They say, history doesn't repeat itself, but it rhymes. I find it interesting how most first democracies [like one in Rome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46ZXl-V4qwY) came about after bad encounter with dictatorship. It's also so easy to glamorize the past where so much of the world was still unexplored and in some ways 'up for grabs'.

I also worked with [Memex](https://getmemex.com) briefly and it's an awesome tool, just need to [make it work for Safari first](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Memex/issues/1134) before I can invest more time in the project.

Onwards. üçÉ
