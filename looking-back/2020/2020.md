# 2020

Switched 2 jobs this year and moved from London back to Netherlands. Taking life a bit more slowly now as 2019 in London was quite hectic. I loved exploring the city & met some amazing people there though.

I kind of documented most of the pains & thoughts I had throughout the year in this journal here so won't repeat again. I didn't take many photos this year and am thinking next year to try to seek to improve my photography skills more practically. Taking a photo each day, no matter what happens.

I like how 'surviving' is one of the top achievements people had this year and that it's okay to have this is as your achievement this year. I can relate to that. Too much pressure is put on success in this world.

My goal for next year is more or less the same as the previous one but with more focus on sustainability and improving my projects & skills further.
