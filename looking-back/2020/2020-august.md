It's August already. On Monday I'm starting my first day as software engineer at [CodeYellow](https://www.codeyellow.nl) in Eindhoven. Quite excited about it.

Found out about [hyperlink.academy](https://hyperlink.academy/) and it's oh so awesome. Very similar to goals of LA. The people behind it are amazing too. [Jared Pereira](https://awarm.space/)'s personal site was a pleasure to read. So happy to read about people solving problems I deeply care get solved too. [Personal Website Chats](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEXbN99LY3OCarUeXcxWeZzOelXQvVdAA) playlist he has on YouTube is amazing too.

Need focus. Until I get last.fm and other imports working for these look backs. Here is a [song](https://open.spotify.com/track/2KjPs5Tm2gammU8qCRcMLJ?si=YcfspKnDRqGZIE5euriDVg) I have on repeat. [Monetochka](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0yp6xP5xe1qarfugfTixOK?si=18Xqy58aTbqX4XVtOtaHqw) is [great](https://medium.com/@ezhikov/monetochka-622a86e91bd2) too.

Want to build a version of [Foam](https://jevakallio.github.io/notes/foam-one-month-in) & [VSCode Memo](https://github.com/svsool/vscode-memo) for Sublime Text. Sublime is my primary way to edit and in some way consume my wiki (when not using the web output (GitBook)). It's quite a lightweight and rather powerful setup but it can be much more powerful. Don't want to use Electron app for this kind of thing even though VSCode is rather nice. Sublime Text just feels much more pleasant to use for markdown editing at least. I also have unique binds that make sense only in context of markdown editing here so it's a nice separation of `Code environment` and general purpose `Writing/Doc environment`.

Need to explore Sublime API. And VSCode too as I want to have more power over my environment. Got Xcode 12 too so excited to start learning Swift/SwiftUI too. I still can't let go of the fact that [Ship GitHub client](https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html) ceased to exist. It was the **perfect** GitHub client. The idea of putting important issues into `Next` queue is so so nice. So yeah, Learn Anything, new personal site, a nice blog with mdx & newsletter. And app me and my GF are building for iOS. And in the future a nice GitHub client to use on macOS unless GitHub officially tackles macOS. And of course the full time job at CodeYellow.

I also started adding more notes to the wiki as part of `## Notes`. Feels nice to extend the wiki in more ways than just adding links which is what I was doing for the past few months.

I wonder sometimes how much I preferred dark interfaces to light some months ago. Used dark mode for **everything** possible. And now I actually prefer light mode for most things. It does make it pleasant that switching to dark mode on both iOS & macOS is seamless and nearly all apps in both ecosystems support both modes. The future is nice.

Oh and one nice thing happened few days ago, [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov) followed me on Twitter. It's the first person with such following to ever follow me and it's quite an amazing feeling as I look up to Dan a lot.

Writing out the above future projects I want to complete in the coming months makes me reflect on how broad my [current goals](../../focusing/goals.md) are.

I also listened to an [amazing interview](https://overcast.fm/+OozP23MDM) with CEO of Loom, Joe. He mentioned how he does weekly [CEO updates authored with Notion and Loom](https://twitter.com/yoyo_thomas/status/1258446807597645824) & it's awesome. Video as screencast format is certainly underused especially as you can playback video at 2x speed.
