It's August already. On Monday I'm starting my first day as software engineer at [CodeYellow](https://www.codeyellow.nl) in Eindhoven. Quite excited about it.

Found out about [hyperlink.academy](https://hyperlink.academy/) and it's oh so awesome. Very similar to goals of LA. The people behind it are amazing too. [Jared Pereira](https://awarm.space/)'s personal site was a pleasure to read. So happy to read about people solving problems I deeply care get solved too. [Personal Website Chats](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEXbN99LY3OCarUeXcxWeZzOelXQvVdAA) playlist he has on YouTube is amazing too.

Overall, once again, there is just too much amazing things happening. Need focus. Until I get last.fm and other imports working for these looks backs. Here is a [song](https://open.spotify.com/track/2KjPs5Tm2gammU8qCRcMLJ?si=YcfspKnDRqGZIE5euriDVg) I have on repeat.
