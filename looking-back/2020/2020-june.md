# 2020 June

Being unemployed with no income during a recession caused by pandemic is tough. I can still afford food for some time but beyond that I don't know.

I am making my way towards building out the new version of Learn Anything as I finally have experience building out real world web applications. It's an interesting journey.

This position I am in makes me sympathize with just how many people are in the state of 'barely making it'.

One other thing that it made me reflect on is just how unsustainable open source everything as a strategy is. I have a `say thanks` button on all my repos including this wiki. And there has been more than 100,000 people who came across my work or use(d) any of the tools I made. And yet I get only [2\$ from one lovely person](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev) every month. It's kind of sad.

As another example, [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/sponsors/tj) only has 36 sponsors and the impact the software he wrote or started to write is certainly worth more than 200\$ dollars or so he gets a month. There are outliers like [Sindre](https://github.com/sponsors/sindresorhus) but that's about it. You can't be acting on pure virtue in this world, it's unsustainable and will lead only to depression and doubt. Open source is a great way to get exposed to businesses that make real money so at least that's good.

And to that point, you can use the community of people who came across your tools and augment open source in a way that can lead to sustainable income. One person [put educational videos under paywall using GitHub Sponsors as authentication](https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it). You have to be creative if you want to make money with open source. The reality is barely anyone will pay you unless forced too. I hope that changes.

For example even in my situation of no income and uncertain future that can lead to hunger and death, I donate monthly to [Tekezo](https://github.com/tekezo) who is [rebuilding Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice) for new macOS.

In short, [GitHub stars won't pay your rent](https://medium.com/@kitze/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent-8b348e12baed) but it can get the word out.

Just finished [Morning show](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-morning-show) and it is amazing especially the last episode. Loved the [ending song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6McEOQxpbWsO4OU0PDfy7x?si=qQ5XPPHPRnC-cWXyCTAnVg). Will watch [Dark](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1275846577526059010) next.

I can't wait until I get into position where I have full creative empowerment. Music/Art for example, if I get into it fully as in spend majority of my time learning and creating art, it would take probably a year or more until I make something someone will want to look or listen to. For now, I am forced to use what I know 'well', computer things & programming.

TIL [grime genre is a thing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23580051). Quite liked [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbZiQ0bKFS0).

For past year or more, I pretty much only listen to instrumental songs like [jazz](https://open.spotify.com/track/0c98X4o6PRxbMjpsOg3tj1?si=0m4U-8xORoS_0XdlUH1ltw) and [Nils](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5gqhueRUZEa7VDnQt4HODp?si=3qoLWAkDQJ6XjKuvnZjS0g) as background noise.

I do have fondness for Russian artists like [Shooval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2My09S8hvZo) or [Miyagi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHtLkGhkP8Y). Something about the culture of Russia that's just unique although I haven't been to Russia in over 10 years now.

[Tracy Chapman](https://open.spotify.com/track/3XkXJNMHJB0UiKiVz83yD7?si=PtHhOOmMQn6eM5hwGg8XkQ) is amazing too.

One thing I need to do is write a monthly scraper that will take data from Instagram/Twitter/LastFM/Letterboxd/Trakt/Goodreads & maybe more services and provide a summary of my internet activity for the month. As part of these look back entries. Would be wonderful to have.

I also want to move this journal away from wiki and onto my site and give it more color. Perhaps this wiki too will move to my own implementation in time. GitBook is awesome and I love the search with suggestions it provides but it does lack a bit of soul.

Alzheimer is a [horrible disease](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt8C-P8Fc4g). Not being able to recognize your own son is just soul crashing.

Need to take cardio more seriously. Running, biking & playing sports. Currently tennis is my favorite sport by far but it needs a partner and a court. The court thing is hard to come by when you lack coins. So cycling/running it is for now.

Need to also start collecting more metrics regarding my health that is not just step count or number of hours of sleep.

Loved this article on [weekly reviews](https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/). I can attribute the usefulness on looking back at your life in a methodical and routine way. Especially as a way to put light on what truly matters to you in the moment, what needs to be done to get there and what needs to be cut from your life that is not helping. And the goals don't have to be aspirational or world changing. What matters is that you care about it.

[Very sad things happening](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23611204). I am doing the best I can to be a cognizant member of society. I don't eat animals and don't travel by plane aside from essential trips. Don't own a car. Recycle everything.

One thing I hope to contribute to this world before I die (if aging doesn't get solved) is an incredible learning/ideas platform that will drive innovations across all fields. Including saving our planet and the animals living in it. Less talk, more building.

When I was in London I came across [London Psychedelic Society](https://psychedelicsociety.org.uk/). It's more UK based actually but they have a nice space in London that I didn't yet get to visit. I love people who tried psychedelics and love talking about them.

[Extrawelt](https://open.spotify.com/track/61tRxmym72kVDioHji8Red?si=4a0oeTW7Qk-KF2kkHGqGpg) is awesome.

This year WWDC is incredible. I cannot wait until macs with Apple chips get released. The future can't come soon enough. Also Xcode & Swift integration is finally [getting it together](https://twitter.com/an0/status/1275953949569400832). Wish Swift libraries had [pkg.dev](https://pkg.go.dev/) equivalent generated with all the APIs and everything.

Also Vim on Xcode. This [XVim2](https://github.com/XVimProject/XVim2) seems to be kind of dead and I can't edit code without vim bindings. ðŸ˜ž

I might just try and write it as a plugin myself. Will learn a lot about Vim in the process too so win win.
