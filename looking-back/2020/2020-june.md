# 2020 June

Money will soon run out and I won't be able to afford any food. Fear of hunger motivates you to make things fast. At least I'm not alone in living in this primal state of fear.

It's silly of me to do so much open source as no one seems to care about it, at least enough to support it financially. I have [2\$ coming from a lovely person](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev). And even that I donate away to [Tekezo](https://github.com/tekezo) because he deserves all the money for [rebuilding Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice).

It's true, [GitHub stars won't pay your rent](https://medium.com/@kitze/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent-8b348e12baed). I wish it wasn't the case but the truth is very few will pay for anything if an option exists not to do it. Giving back feels great and all but it's not worth the stress of doing it as your main thing. I don't personally think that the work I put out right now as it stands is worth 2\$ a month but that's the reality. I could of course do more to show the value the software & tools I build bring to me through articles/videos & better docs (and I plan to do it) but that still won't be enough and it's a shame.

That said, scarcity of resources teaches you to be minimal by necessity and it has value. The food I eat being veggies & fruits is cheap. So is making your own coffee and tea. You don't need much to survive and live a healthy life (the most important thing). The rent is annoying and sadly I can't avoid paying it due to my contract which finally ends in August. I paid for an empty apartment for 5 months in which I lived only the first month. FML.

Thanks to [John](https://github.com/jletey), LA is moving forward, slowly. Been loving using [Linear](https://linear.app/) to track issues. Inspires you to build beautiful & useful software. So much attention to detail. It's lovely.

The value of this journal is in looking back. Some say to put all the 'thank you' emails you get in a folder and read it on your bad days. Another thing that helps is in reading yourself from back in the day [when you were depressed](../2018/2018-april.md) and sighing with relief that that time is passed. It helps.

The amount of rejections and failure I had to experience in a span of a year is insane. Nothing phases me any more because it's life. Things happen and all you can do is control your response and reaction. Replan and move forward. There's also the crazy stuff that happens in the world like [billions of dollars being stolen](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/h16knm/speaking_of_looting_trump_admin_refuses_to/). The rules being set by the few people that have control over the running system. Everything is so broken. This [interview with Bret Weinstein](https://overcast.fm/+setAHw) is pretty great showcase of it. [The Portal](https://overcast.fm/itunes1469999563/the-portal) podcast has lots of nice discussions. The main point being is erosion of [our right to disagree](https://wincent.com/blog/on-the-right-to-disagree). It's [hard to have civil conversations without being labeled as racist or some bad person](https://overcast.fm/+KhqFMR3J4).

I will focus on what I have control over. Learning by reading and building things I care about building. I also can't wait to play as a cat in [Stray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84hRUQlaio). ðŸ˜»

[Morning show](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-morning-show) is amazing especially the [last episode](https://open.spotify.com/track/6McEOQxpbWsO4OU0PDfy7x?si=qQ5XPPHPRnC-cWXyCTAnVg). Makes me want to do something creative that's not building automations and websites.

On topic of open source, the fact that [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/sponsors/tj) only has 36 sponsors says all that needs to be said about sustainability of open source. The impact the software he wrote or started to write is certainly worth more than measly 200\$ dollars or so he gets a month. There are outliers like [Sindre](https://github.com/sponsors/sindresorhus) & it is great to see. But there's few more like Sindre and then there's the rest. Although with some Twitter following and marketing clout you can [potentially earn money with open source](https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it).

Basic income can't come soon enough so everyone has access to [work in public](https://nayafia.substack.com/p/22-working-in-public).

TIL [grime genre is a thing](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23580051). It's pretty [ðŸ”¥](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbZiQ0bKFS0).

Alzheimer disease is [brutal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt8C-P8Fc4g).

Can't afford a nice bike now sadly so will go for a run every morning + really take my health seriously, maybe try some fasting too. It's sad how at the end of the day we are just bodies that break down. Faster and faster as we age. So it goes.

I should really read more fiction books like Slaughterhouse-Five. It's just hard to do when your income totals to 2\$. ðŸ˜ž

Need to learn so freaking much. And build and build.
