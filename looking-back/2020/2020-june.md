# 2020 June

Money will soon run out and I won't be able to afford any food. Fear of hunger & lack of place to live in motivates you to make things fast. It's probably silly of me to do so much open source as no one seems to care about it, at least enough to support it financially. I have 2\$ coming in from a lovely person. And even that I donate away to [Tekezo](https://github.com/tekezo) because he deserves all the money for building Karabiner.

It's true, [GitHub stars won't pay your rent](https://medium.com/@kitze/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent-8b348e12baed). I wish we lived in a world where that's not the case and where earning money from open source was easier. There's a few people reading this wiki, I thought about putting some notice or something to ask for a donation. It's probably the case though that the things I've released thus far are not that great nor is the value proposition too clear. Will try solve this with more educational content once I release my new site with a blog.

Having said that, it is possible to be light on spending. Only buy fruits and veggies. Make your own coffee, drink tea. The costs aren't that bad. The rent is the biggest annoyance but I live with my girlfriend now and she is kind enough to not make me pay the half of her rent.

Thanks to [John](https://github.com/jletey), LA is moving forward, slowly. Been loving using [Linear](https://linear.app/) for issue management. Inspires you to build beautiful & useful software. So much attention to detail. It's lovely.

One other thing about money is that it does constraint creativity. Having to not think about how to get enough money for food and roof over your head limits your expressive power. Need to speed moving towards the future where no one on Earth is left in this position.

Having said all that, I can't wait to look back on this entry in 1 year if I am still alive by then, hopefully with a smile that I won't reach a low point in my life ever again. In other news, I can't wait to play as a cat in [Stray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84hRUQlaio). ðŸ˜»
