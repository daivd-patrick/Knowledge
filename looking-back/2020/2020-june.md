# 2020 June

Money will soon run out and I won't be able to afford any food. Fear of hunger & lack of place to live in motivates you to make things fast. It's probably silly of me to do so much open source as no one seems to care about it, at least enough to support it financially. I have 2\$ coming in from a lovely person. And even that I donate away to [Tekezo](https://github.com/tekezo) because he deserves all the money for building Karabiner.

It's true, [GitHub stars won't pay your rent](https://medium.com/@kitze/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent-8b348e12baed). I wish we lived in a world where that's not the case and where earning money from open source was easier. There's a few people reading this wiki & probably a few more that use my workflows. I wonder if anyone actually does find value in what I created or the more likely, they don't see the value of it due to my lack of presentational content around the things I created and how they relate to my workflow & solving of problems. Hope to solve it soon with my newly released blog & more videos made.

It is possible to be light on spending though. Only buy fruits and veggies. Make your own coffee, drink tea. The costs aren't that bad. The rent is the biggest annoyance but I live with my girlfriend now and she is kind enough to not make me pay the half of her rent.

Thanks to [John](https://github.com/jletey), LA is moving forward, slowly. Been loving using [Linear](https://linear.app/) for issue management. Inspires you to build beautiful & useful software. So much attention to detail. It's lovely.

One other thing about money is that it does constraint creativity. Having to not think about how to get enough money for food and roof over your head limits your expressive power. Need to speed moving towards the future where no one on Earth is left in this position.

I can't wait to look back on this entry in 1 year if I am still alive by then, hopefully with a smile that I won't reach a low point in my life ever again, although I've [been worse](../2018/2018-april.md). I have been rejected & failed so many times that I like to think nothing can phase me any more. Aside from some physical trauma. I thought before how bad it is that I get to experience all this failure despite trying my hardest. Asking myself what I did wrong, should I have not taken time off and instead worked more so as to not fail. You read about these stories of burnout and you do sympathize with it. Just a shame that some people get to do what they love and get paid for it and others have to work hard to only be met with failure and unhappiness. Alternatively you can try get into positions of power & [blatantly abuse the system](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/h16knm/speaking_of_looting_trump_admin_refuses_to/) because you are the one who sets the rules.

In other news, I can't wait to play as a cat in [Stray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u84hRUQlaio). ðŸ˜»

Morning show was amazing especially the last episode. Really want to do something creative that's not building automations and websites. Will read more prose.

[Stay positive](https://open.spotify.com/track/6McEOQxpbWsO4OU0PDfy7x?si=qQ5XPPHPRnC-cWXyCTAnVg). So much crazy and cool stuff happening.

Honestly though. The fact that [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/sponsors/tj) himself only has 36 sponsors says all that needs to be said about sustainability of open source. There are outliers like [Sindre](https://github.com/sponsors/sindresorhus) & it is great to see. It's inspiring how Sindre can focus entirely on open source and cut the barriers of access to 0 for everything he creates with the entire world building off his work (yay oss ðŸŽŠ).

Aside from LA that I hope I can finally release with a sustainable model, I have another app idea that I think will solve a huge issue on mobile that scales well and adds a ton of value. It's all overwhelming to say the least.
