Being unemployed with no income is tough. I can still afford food for some time but if I don't find work or release something worth selling soon. Don't want to think about it yet.

I'm not alone in being in this position. The fear of hunger and lack of place to sleep under is quite primal to most humans.

It's just hard for me to comprehend how close everyone is to just 'not making it'. Makes you sympathize.

It's unwise to do everything in the open as I do now as one thing you learn is that pretty much no one will support you financially for it. There is a `say thanks` button on all my repos including this wiki. And there is more than 100000 people who came across my work or use(d) any of the tools I made. And yet I get [2\$ from one lovely person](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev) every month. It's wild how unsustainable open source is.

I mean [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/sponsors/tj) only has 36 sponsors and the impact the software he wrote or started to write is certainly worth more than 200\$ dollars or so he gets a month. There are outliers like [Sindre](https://github.com/sponsors/sindresorhus) but that's about it. Although with some Twitter following and forcefulness, you can [potentially earn sustainable income with open source](https://calebporzio.com/i-just-hit-dollar-100000yr-on-github-sponsors-heres-how-i-did-it).

Just makes me sad that my dream of anyone in the world being able to build off and use the things I wrote/made at no cost is so hard to achieve. Or maybe I'm not smart about achieving it.

I have no income and quickly eroding savings I had from last job, and still I donate money because some people deserve it like [Tekezo](https://github.com/tekezo) who is [rebuilding Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-DriverKit-VirtualHIDDevice) for new macOS.

[GitHub stars won't pay your rent](https://medium.com/@kitze/github-stars-wont-pay-your-rent-8b348e12baed). Just the world we live in.

[Morning show](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-morning-show) is amazing especially the [last episode](https://open.spotify.com/track/6McEOQxpbWsO4OU0PDfy7x?si=qQ5XPPHPRnC-cWXyCTAnVg). Makes me want to do something creative that's not building tools and websites.

TIL [grime genre](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23580051) is a [thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbZiQ0bKFS0). Listening to mostly [jazz](https://open.spotify.com/track/0c98X4o6PRxbMjpsOg3tj1?si=0m4U-8xORoS_0XdlUH1ltw) and [Nils](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5gqhueRUZEa7VDnQt4HODp?si=3qoLWAkDQJ6XjKuvnZjS0g) as background noise. Also quite fond of Russian artists like [Shooval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2My09S8hvZo) or [Miyagi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHtLkGhkP8Y). [Tracy Chapman](https://open.spotify.com/track/3XkXJNMHJB0UiKiVz83yD7?si=PtHhOOmMQn6eM5hwGg8XkQ) is great too.

I need to write code to scrape off Insta/Twitter/Last.fm/Letterboxd/Trakt/Goodreads/.. to enrich these looking back entries with more contextual data.

Alzheimer disease is [brutal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt8C-P8Fc4g) ðŸ˜¢.

Need to take cardio more seriously. Running, biking & playing sports. Tennis is my favorite.

Should also start collecting more metrics regarding my health that is not just step count or number of hours of sleep. There should be tools/software to make this easier.

And I need to make my [weekly reviews](https://www.benkuhn.net/weekly/) include health lookups.

[F\*\*\*\*](https://twitter.com/James_BG/status/1275349110661558280). Once I solve this education thing once and for all, I am working on anything related to clean energy. It's bizarre how anyone can work on anything else given what's coming.
