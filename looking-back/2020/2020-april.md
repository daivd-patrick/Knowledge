Things you do and words you speak matter.

It's sad how much time is wasted arguing over how [corrupt United States](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/fx03ri/upm_me_all_dogs_lays_out_the_trump/) or your government is and how things need change.

Just want to be a human being. Loving [animals](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/environment/veganism) and going about my day existing.

So much news, so pointless.

I am reading some good books now:

- [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829182.Computer_Systems)
- [Algorithms Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/145055.Algorithm_Design)
- [xv6 a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28241422-xv6-a-simple-unix-like-teaching-operating-system)
- [Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and the Emergence of Spacetime](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44065062-something-deeply-hidden)

with these tabs open

- https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples

As I try to setup backend for LA. Not sure yet how to expose postgres to the front end in nextJS. Will try out Prisma if it works well, if it doesn't will probably setup Hasura instead and write all the backend logic inside go services.
