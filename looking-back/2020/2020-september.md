Excited for Spring. Moving to new place on 14th in Eindhoven. The place is finally a bit nicer than any other place I've lived in before. In London I've lived in a closet. A closet that was close to office but still. It was right above a noisy street and the roof leaked water every time it rained.

Wrote a [script](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1300497250800500736) to save links in clipboard to a text file. Super fast. Will move it to LA next. So much to build. üë®‚Äçüíª

I've also been enjoying using Safari for everything (not just web browsing). Previously I used Chrome for web dev but now I realize that Chrome does have some nice features in its dev tools but more often Safari feels faster and the dev tools it has do what I need already. Look cleaner too.

Another thing that's nice to see is more people [getting into Karabiner](https://dev.to/swyx/notes-on-karabiner-elements-from-john-lindquist-4cmo). I actually raided the stream and found out about Karabiner's ability to map keys based off how many fingers lie on the trackpad. In the end though this workflow isn't for me as I don't see much usefulness in it as it requires you to type a key anyway so just use layers. It's neat still.
