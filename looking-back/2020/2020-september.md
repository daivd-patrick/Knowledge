Excited for Spring. Moving to new place on 14th in Eindhoven. The place is finally a bit nicer than any other place I've lived in before. In London I've lived in a closet. A closet that was close to office but still. It was right above a noisy street and the roof leaked water every time it rained.

Wrote a [script](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1300497250800500736) to save links in clipboard to a text file. Super fast. Will move it to LA next. So much to build. üë®‚Äçüíª

I've also been enjoying using Safari for everything (not just web browsing). Previously I used Chrome for web dev but now I realize that Chrome does have some nice features in its dev tools but more often Safari feels faster and the dev tools it has do what I need already. Look cleaner too.

Another thing that's nice to see is more people [getting into Karabiner](https://dev.to/swyx/notes-on-karabiner-elements-from-john-lindquist-4cmo). I actually raided the stream and found out about Karabiner's ability to map keys based off how many fingers lie on the trackpad. In the end though this workflow isn't for me as I don't see much usefulness in it as it requires you to type a key anyway so just use layers. It's neat still.

There should be more services like [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email). Solve a problem well and that's it (counter example [Dropbox](https://tonsky.me/blog/syncthing/)). And be [transparent about it](https://www.notion.so/Running-Costs-f29729ded5494272947f656440967cbf). It's run by a [single person](https://buttondown.email/features/run-by-a-human) too.

The breakdown of running costs is actually very useful to see. Would love to see cost breakdowns for more larger companies like Stripe. Gives more perspective on what scale means and how resources can be used efficiently.

I extended [my workflow](../../sharing/my-workflow.md) further to add some detail to my preferred tools of working. There is some overlap with [rules](../../focusing/rules.md). Hope to get a more clear difference between the two. And for processes, I hope to build a dedicate service/app for it. As processes need to be actionable.

Pleasantly surprised my macOS post is 31st [most favorited post on HN](https://observablehq.com/@tomlarkworthy/hacker-favourites-analysis). Need to build/ship more things. ‚ú®

Came across another public company wiki, this time by [Gumroad](https://www.notion.so/Public-Wiki-72663c59ed5a432a9d52accafd8f166e). Going to improve our wiki for LA. There is a [nice thread on going async for work](https://twitter.com/shl/status/1222545212477599751) too.

Remembered today I once had a huge collection of songs I collected in FLAC locally. Lots of albums neatly sorted including Alt-J, Tame Impala and lots more. What is a shame is that I deleted the entire hard drive where all these songs & albums were stored as I sold the hard drive to some person. Because minimalism. üòø

Extended my rules with: No Regrets. It does hurt as there were songs in there that I don't have in my Spotify collection any more and I don't think I'll ever find them again. The world of music is a big place. Feels good to write it though as it's been bugging me for 2 days now. Regret sucks.

In other news, I am not writing here as much as I try to learn use Twitter more. Plus soonish the feeds of this journal & Twitter will be combined into one nice page.

It's also quite interesting how obsessive I once was in collecting lossless music. I didn't even have any fancy gear to play and appreciate the lossless format. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[Every day should be a mental health day.](https://twitter.com/techgirl1908/status/1309214827030540288)

I üòª [Remotive](https://remotive.io/) site design. So cute. Found it out through [MakeHub](https://makehub.io/).

In 5 days I will send out my first newsletter. Excited. Would be curious to see how the format of the newsletter will evolve with time. I think the initial send out will be greatly influenced by [Gwern's newsletter](https://www.gwern.net/tags/newsletter) layout. Some links, some music. Some personal thoughts. Some photos. And a little boost for the next month to keep myself and maybe others going in chasing their dreams.

Started to work on a [little game](https://github.com/intr3st/divinity) using [Godot](https://godotengine.org) with my little brother and sister. It's theirs and my first game ever made. But will start small. The first task is to read through Godot docs and make a box movable with arrow keys on a 2d grid.

I personally want to create something like Among Us.
