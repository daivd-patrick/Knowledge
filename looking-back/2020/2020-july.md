Working outside or in sunny areas made me appreciate light modes a lot more. It's nice how iOS forces apps to provide both light & dark themes of apps. On macOS most apps have both modes too but the automatic switching according to OS setting is not yet available everywhere. Hopefully it gets added to all apps I use, specifically Discord, Sublime Text, Sublime Merge, iTerm, Notion are missing it.

And not a lot of websites use [prefers-color-scheme CSS feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme). Would be nice if browsers shipped with a nice version of [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) for sites that don't have prefers-color-scheme property. Don't want to run an extension just for this. Also I found most dark websites are not that accessible compared to light ones. Perhaps it's harder to make dark sites accessible.
