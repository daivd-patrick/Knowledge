Working outside or in sunny areas made me appreciate light modes a lot more. It's nice how iOS forces apps to provide both light & dark themes of apps. On macOS most apps have both modes too but the automatic switching according to OS setting is not yet available everywhere. Hopefully it gets added to all apps I use, specifically Discord, Sublime Text, Sublime Merge, iTerm, Notion are missing it.
