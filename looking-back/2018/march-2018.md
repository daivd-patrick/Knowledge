## Changes
- (1) Going to take Timing a __lot__ more seriously this month. And get some work done!
- (2) Going to use Trello exclusively for managing projects.
- (4) Adding this change from iOS. Moved the wiki to Dropbox and hooked up Ulysses to edit the folder on iOS. Pretty amazing.
- (5) Made my first crypto purchase. Pretty awesome experience.
- (7) Removed lessons learned from wiki. Only have [rules](../../focusing/rules.md) and [processes](../../focusing/processes.md) now. Each of the files is binded to a key so I can open in a second. Should itearate on all of it with time and find what works the best for me.
- (7) 10,000 ⭐ on [Learn Anything](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything). 🎊

- (7) Going to use and abuse IFTTT a bit more and rally various online info I create like Tweets I made into Google spreadsheets. I want to make some meaningful analysis on this data later + it's nice to save for proseterity as I can save it as PDF for later viewing.
- (8) Will review all movies I watch from now on.
- (10) Started usig [Gitter](https://gitter.im/learn-anything) and our [Reddit subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnanything_) as our official way to communicate with the community around LA. Slack was a closed silo that doesn't work well with OSS projects.
- (10) New format to monthly reviews. There are now `Weekly reviews` as well as `Shipped` category to track things I actually make and publish. Articles, code, projects. `Changes` then is more as a way of tracking _other_ things. Changes to workflow and whatnot. And `Thoughts` still stay as I find it quite a useful outlet for things. The ending 'credits' will include music I tracked on [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/playfullyExist) & my tweets for that month. Would love to add some more things in time, my own new project I am working on will help in that regard quite a bit. Cleaned up my [books](../../books/books.md) entry and it's really clean list of books I read and started with my reviews attached. Will also be adding books I read in this month here though. Trying to optimise my [processes](../../focusing/processes.md) to account for all these things and simplify and 'automate' my life in this way. There is a lot of merit in keeping things simple but actually doing this kind of looking back thing. It keeps me accountable and motivates me to __do more__. I hope to refine my process with time and ship things perhaps not daily but at least weekly. Something new. Something I made.
- (12) Going to __finally__ learn vim.

## Thoughts
- (4) Cryptocurrencies are really the future of money. No fees. Instant pay across the globe. Peer to peer with no intermediaries. It's exciting.
- (7) Still wonder what it's like to work at a company or even a startup. Being a one person team for all my life aside from Learn Anything project and Angelo is quite tiring and brings you down with time. I think being surrounded by a team of people who inspire and empower you is amazing. Maybe one day I can find myself to be in that team.
