## Shared

## Diary
- (2) Stopped listening to music for a while now. I now listen to music as a way to find new tunes and relax rather than as a way to listen to things just to dull the background noise. I use [Noizio](http://noiz.io) for that now and love it. So my last.fm is looking a bit empty compared to the previous months.
- (2) Also renamed `Notes` to `Diary` as I think I found a perfect workflow that really works for me in doing this kind of diary. `Shared`, `Diary` and `Photos` is all I really want to remember from the month. Private memories and notes will still be in Day One. A `Travel` section would be really awesome to have too.
- (2) One of my goals in Trello board this month is: `Mindful everything. Writing. Working. Coding.`. It's really freeing coming down and using only the essential things and living with a more reductionist approach of minimising both daily input to things that matter as well as focusing on pruducing work that really matters too. No bullshit inbetween. My Trello `Focus` board is starting to pay its devidends too. I now keep all my Trello boards scoped to cards that I am assigned to. Which means cards I am currently working on. This way I can tune to work only on the projects & goals that matter to me at that given time. For now, my goal is to finish my university and finally getting my Bachelor's degree.
