## Diary
- (2) Stopped listening to music for a while now. I now listen to music as a way to find new tunes and relax rather than as a way to listen to things just to dull the background noise. I use [Noizio](http://noiz.io) for that now and love it. So my last.fm is looking a bit empty compared to the previous months.
- (2) Also renamed `Notes` to `Diary` as I think I found a perfect workflow that really works for me in doing this kind of diary. `Shared`, `Diary` and `Photos` is all I really want to remember from the month. Private memories and notes will still be in Day One. A `Travel` section would be really awesome to have to though in time.
