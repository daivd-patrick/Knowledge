## Diary
- (2) Stopped listening to music for a while now. I now listen to music as a way to find new tunes and relax rather than as a way to listen to things just to dull the background noise. I use [Noizio](http://noiz.io) for that now and love it. So my last.fm is looking a bit empty compared to the previous months.
- (2) Also renamed `Notes` to `Diary` as I think I found a perfect workflow that really works for me in doing this kind of diary. `Shared`, `Diary` and `Photos` is all I want to remember from the month. Private memories and notes will still be in Day One. A `Travel` section would be really awesome to have too.
- (2) One of my goals in Trello board this month is: `Mindful everything. Writing. Working. Coding.`. It's really freeing coming down and using only the essential things and living with a more reductionist approach of minimising both daily input to things that matter as well as focusing on pruducing work that really matters too. No bullshit inbetween. My Trello `Focus` board is starting to pay its devidends too. I now keep all my Trello boards scoped to cards that I am assigned to. Which means cards I am currently working on. This way I can tune to work only on the projects & goals that matter to me at that given time. For now, my goal is to finish my university and finally getting my Bachelor's degree.

- (4) [Richard Litt](https://github.com/RichardLitt) also started a public monthly diary log of things he is working on and he wrote a bit on [why he made it](https://richardlitt.github.io/2018-april/2018/04/04/11-31-why-am-i-writing-on-this-site/) with which I agree. This diary is also only the beggining. I am certain in future, these `looking back` posts will probably not even be hosted with GitBook but perhaps lie on my personal site. With better visualisations and much shorter and to the point entries as I learn more on how to effectively transcribe my thoughts on paper and what things to write about. So yeah, diaries are pretty awesome.
- (9) I feel like I can write a book about decision fatigue and the paradox of choice. It has been a growing issue in my life for too long of a time and despite me being 'aware' of the issue, I still fall in the same trap of inability to do things because there is just 'too many things' I need to be doing and too much pressure on doing things right. Priorotising the right things, accepting to fail at something because something else is more important. It's painful and above all frustrating. Which in turns causes me to enter a rather negative loop of self hatred and depression. Not even self hatred but hate for me not being able to change my surroundings in a meaningful way because I have no money, I can't finish my degree and a plethora of other reasons like having 0 internships or any kind of work experience. Because literally no one on Earth wants to hire me. I did however find this [Wisdom of Insecurity](https://antilogicalism.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/wisdom-of-insecurity.pdf) book by no other than Alan Watts. Perhaps it will help. It's funny how even when you are 'aware' of how irrational it is to feel sad or to feel any kind of anxiety, you still feel it. And it still hurts.
- (9) [My macOS repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) hit 10,000 ðŸŒŸ

- (9) Itâ€™s sad not being in control of my time and what I want I want to be doing. But I have to learn to take control of my mind and go against it doing only what it likes. Although it would be wonderful to some day reach a stage in my life where I love every single day and am doing what I want to be doing every single day. But that day is not today. And until then, less talking and more doing.
- (10) Lesson learned. Just make the CV in Pages or some visual editor and donâ€™t bother with LaTeX. This way I get more control over the looks of it and itâ€™s easier to maintain. I should also finally use my CV and apply everywhere. This bachelorâ€™s degree is killing me. Forcing students to memorize a bunch of rules & formulas to pass the exam/tests is absurd in 2018. I hope future is going to be better than this.
- (10) Going to start using Swarm again to check into various places. It's pretty awesome so far.
- (10) I really think that Karabiner, VS Code and mac + internet is all you need to do anything you want in the world. No education needed aside from knowing how not to give up and stick with it. Everything else comes from practice. It also helps not to have constant anxiety and pressure of not doing good enough compared to your peers and friends which is all too easy in our extremely interconnected world. I hope to really live by this though. Independent thinking. Independend mind. Solving problems that matter and increasing my own productivity & happiness every day.
- (12) It's my birthday and I got to stop being sad. It's pitiful. Worst thing about depression is the time when you just accept it. You accept that it won't get better and this is going to be your life. It's then much harder to get out of this hole you dug yourself into as you are **always** going to be upset, no matter what happens to you. You will ignore the little good things that happen to you and amplify all the bad. The worst thing is that I actually know what I can do to be happy, it's just I can't dedicate myself fully to it. Depression sucks. And chronic depression is just horrible. And any advice that you read on depression and bad states of mind is barely helpful as any true change starts from within yourself. Exercise, some sunlight and good nutrition with sleep does go a long way though and that's what I want to focus on. No excuses.
- (13) Should really read more fiction books and improve my writing. I want a richer set of vocabulary to draw things from. I love how certain words can capture some things so much better and more compact that the writing just flows from word to word. I haven't read many fiction books yet but I am changing that slowly and adapting the ideas I take away from it in my writing and new ideas.
- (14) One thing I miss from doing this public diary here instead of Day One is `On This Day` feature which is phenomenal in Day One. I don't think it would be hard to replicate it here too as I already add numbers of days I wrote my entries in and under which month. Will be a fun thing to add in the future.
- (14) Going to work on a `no complaining` habit from now on. Complaining achieves nothing in the grand scheme of things and I have done my share deal of it lately.
