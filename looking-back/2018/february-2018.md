# February 2018
## Highlights
- Completely updated my wiki and now everything is quite clean and tidy.
- Started using [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font. And generally started to pay attention to fonts more. Fira Code is amazing.
- Automated [dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles) with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

## Changes
- Started using Ship app more often for GitHub issues.
	- Will try to triage as many open issues I have across all my repos.
	- Have a pretty sweet setup going with 2Do, Trello, Fantastical and Ship.
- Want to try not use mind map for documenting my Karabiner config but try a method of self documenting.
- Want to try to be a lot more active on Twitter. It's a pretty amazing platform.
