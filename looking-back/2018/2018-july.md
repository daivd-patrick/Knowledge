## Diary
- (4) I might keep this diary after all. It has been a very stressful past couple of weeks. Added a 'simple' habit of `No complaints` to Streaks. Such a powerful habit yet quite a hard one to really follow through with, at least for me. I am insanely dissatisfied of where I am in life. I read that university should be this great place where you get to learn awesome things, meet new people and actually have some will in you to live, learn and create. In my case university sucked anything creative from me and has been destroying me inside for over two damn years. And it seems there is no escape from this constant state of sadness because I lost all hope for my life and hate every moment that I don't get to spend on things that I truly care about. I want to learn and create things at my own pace. I want to not feel depressed about it and I want something to change in my life. Anything, really.
- (4) Here's to the resurrection of this diary though. I haven't touched [Day One](../../macOS/apps/day-one.md) in quite a while now aside from occasional dream journal entries. And I quite like keeping things organized and clean, and this looking back pieces genuinely make me happy in some ways. Maybe this Summer will let me focus my mind and actually steer the boat that is my life in the right direction.
- (4) Completed my final exam today for the year. I am still not sure if I should really follow through with uni after all this time. Perhaps I am just not smart enough for a CS degree and I should do art or law or something. I feel like I grew a lot as a person over this time though and actually 'matured' in some ways. In others not so much. Like my ability to prepare and do well on exams.
- (4) For now though I have two interviews coming up, hoping those two go well. I also can now fully and I mean really fully focus on finally fixing my OS. Fixing Karabiner, installing new version of OS, getting my development environment *just right* again. And build those [ideas](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP) into the world.
- (5) My biggest problem I think is that I can't perform under stress. Fortunately I think I **finally** [solved it for myself](../../research/solving-problems.md).
	1. Write what I want to do in Alfred. Or take the task from 2Do, Trello, MindNode or by selecting some text. And now it's my **active TODO**. I **have to do it** and nothing else.
	2. If I ever feel I get distracted, I press a hotkey and my active task is shown in the middle of the screen with Alfred.
- (5) So far this approach has been working extremely effectively for me. I think all my failures, or what I consider as failures at least, stem from my disability to focus. Focus my mind to do the things I **need to be doing** in the moment and not succumbing to external pressures like stress or worry or comparing myself to literally anything else in the universe.
