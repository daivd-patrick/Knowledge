## FB blocked Learn Anything
Learn Anything was banned from both Facebook and Instagram platforms.

No one can share or send messages of the website to anyone. Facebook won't allow it.

Moreover FB decided to delete all mentiones of the website off their `platform`. Even my own posts.

It's a real shame how a company can dictate what other people see or say and will block anything that even remotely questions the ethics of what they do.

My last post on FB. Have no idea why I didn't delete my account already given things I know about the company.

Will be exploring [Scuttlebutt](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz) and other decentralised solutions for sharing news and communicating. It makes no sense to live in a world where a company can choose what its users should see, do or talk about.

## Highlights
- [Added all the Keyboard Maestro macros I use and love to my macOS repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/km).
- Started working through [Leetcode](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/leetcode) problems and preparing for interviews.
- Stopped using FB. Deleted the account.

## Changes
- Started using Trello a lot more.
- Moved to using Sublime Text more for editing wiki. And generally optimised a lot of my wiki editing so I can edit any wiki entry in seconds.
	- This wiki as it stands now is only the beginning. I think I laid a good foundation for it going forward. I do need to write full articles more often too though.
