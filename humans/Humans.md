# Humans
Being a human myself, I can't but be amazed and inspired by what other people have both created before me and are creating right now. 

I have many interests and I find studying and looking into people who have spent their time studying some of these topics is a really good investment of my time. It's also quite amazing that nowadays you can potentially message a person whose work you like and sometimes they can respond.

In any way, I maintain a list of all the interesting humans across all the different disciplines [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/humans).
