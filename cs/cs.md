Studies computation. 

What is computation and what is computable is actually quite fascinating. Apparently not all things are computable as was proved by Alan Turing with the [Halting problem](https://learn-anything.xyz/mathematics/computability-theory/turing-completeness/halting-problem). 

Lambda Calculus is also something really interesting as it tries to define computation symbolically from what I understand. I still am yet to really understand it and Haskell + all the rich functional programming ecosystem. There is quite a lot out there, really.
