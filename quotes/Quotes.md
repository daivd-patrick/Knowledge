# Quotes

Here are some quotes I like. 

# Life

- The teacher appears when the student is ready

# Privacy

- Today's surveillance is extremely stealthy. If a person was following you all day, writing down what you are doing, of course you would care. But the problem today is, most people don't see the person following them.

# Funny

- If computer science fundamentals are so important why do I only think about them during interviews?
