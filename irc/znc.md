## Modules I use
- [Advanced ZNC playback](http://wiki.znc.in/Playback)
- [Mutter](https://wiki.znc.in/Mutter)

## ZNC commands
- `/quote detach ..` - Detach a channel from ZNC
	- i.e. `/quote detach ##graphics`
	- Pay attention to the slashes as they matter.
	- Connecting back is then simply `/join ..` (or connecting through Textual GUI click).
- `/znc jump` - Reconnect to the network. Useful for activating changes you made to the ZNC itself. Such as changing real name or nick.
