# IRC

I spend quite a lot of my time on Freenode as it has so many really useful channel and people that can help you.

I use [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/ "Textual") IRC client and I use [ZNC](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/ZNC) network bouncer to always keep me logged in to the servers and keep history logs when I am away. 

# IRC commands
  
Textual keeps a command reference [here](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Command-Reference.kb).

- `/list`
	- will open channel list
