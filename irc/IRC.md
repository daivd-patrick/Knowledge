# IRC
I spend quite a lot of my time on Freenode as it has so many really useful channels and people that can help you.

I use [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/ "Textual") IRC client and I use [ZNC](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/ZNC) network bouncer to always keep me logged in to the servers as well as it keeping history logs when I am away. 

## IRC commands  
Textual keeps a command reference [here](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Command-Reference.kb).
- `/list` - will open channel list

## ZNC commands
- `/znc detach ..` - will detach a channel from znc
	- i.e. `/znc detach ##graphics`
	- pay attention to the slashes as they matter
	- connecting back is then simply `/join ..` (or connecting through Textual GUI click)
