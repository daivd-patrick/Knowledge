I spend quite a lot of my time on Freenode as it has so many really useful channels and people that can help you.

I use [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/ "Textual") IRC client and I use [ZNC](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/ZNC) network bouncer to always keep me logged in to the servers as well as it keeping history logs when I am away.

Here are the IRC channels I very often frequent:
