# ZNC
## ZNC commands
- `/quote detach ..` - will detach a channel from znc
	- i.e. `/quote detach ##graphics`
	- pay attention to the slashes as they matter
	- connecting back is then simply `/join ..` (or connecting through Textual GUI click)

## Notes
- [modules](https://wiki.znc.in/Modules) are quite interesting
