Studies how our universe behaves.

Many great things came from trying to understand how this world is put together and what laws govern it.

Perhaps we can replicate a universe like ours in the future. One of the more interesting thoughts to ponder on is how complexity can emerge from rather simple rules. One example of that is [cellular automata](https://learn-anything.xyz/mathematics/computability-theory/cellular-automata) and the infamous [Conway's game of life](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
