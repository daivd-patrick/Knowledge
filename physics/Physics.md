Studies how our universe behaves. 

Many great things came from trying to understand how this world is put together and what laws govern it.

Perhaps we can replicate a universe like ours in the future. One of the more interesting thoughts to ponder on is how complexity can emerge from rather simple rules. One example of that is [cellular automata][1] and the infamous [Conway's game of life][2]. I believe [Stephen Wolfram][3] is working on trying to answer these questions.
