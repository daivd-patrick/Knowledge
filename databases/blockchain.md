# Blockchain
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3aJI1ABdjQk) was a really great video intro to the blockchain.

In short, blockchain is a [linked list of hashes](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-blockchain-essentially-a-linked-list?share=1). Which can be used to solve the double spending problem in cryptocurrencies using proof of work and a persistent chain of records (blocks mined).

## Consensus algorithms
- PoW: The more hashing power the more trust worthy.
- PoS: The more coins the more trust worthy.
- PBFT: Hand selected trusted nodes.
- Randomized asynchronous algorithm: You trust nobody! Every single node is constantly re-evaluated. ([Skycoin](https://www.skycoin.net))
