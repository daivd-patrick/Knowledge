# [Go](https://golang.org)
Go is currently my favourite programming language.

I mostly love the tooling around it like [VS Code](../../text-editors/vs-code/vs-code.md) and its [Go plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go). The powerful  `go` command line tool and the rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that people have built.

Go promotes composition over inheritance.

## Commenting Go code
- Comments documenting declarations should be full sentences.
- Comments should begin with the name of the thing being described and end in a period.

## Error checking
- You can `log.Fatal(err)` when playing with code.
	- In actual applications you need to decide what you need to do with each error response - bail immediately, pass it to the caller, show it to the user, log it and continue, etc ...

## Notes
- I can call functions from anywhere if they are in the same package.
- The package “main” tells the Go compiler that the package should compile as an executable program instead of a shared library.
- Note that any type implements the empty interface interface{} because it doesn't have any methods and all types have zero methods by default.
- Simply pushing my source code to GitHub, makes it `go get`table.
- Interface types represent fixed sets of methods.
- the prevailing wisdom in Go is to use a flat directory structure and only create new directories when you are building self-contained functionality.
- `go get` = download the source code to your PC.
- `go install` = download, build, and put it in the path so you can use it.
- I don't need to comment all functions as some are self describing. I do need to comment exported functions however.
- I [can put my Go projects not in my GOPATH if I am not planning to release them publically as library or cli tool](https://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH). i.e. My Alfred workflows live in `~/src/alfred` and not in my GOPATH and are still writen in Go.
- `go run` looks at the paths you specify.  `go build` takes the package(s) you specify and uses GOPATH to find their location.
- [What works really well is to use Go to create an HTTP API and leave the rest (html templates etc) to a client-side frontend (e.g. React). That gives you the best of both worlds: a fast and lightweight backend in Go with a rich frontend in JS.](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/8eeolx/recommended_web_framework_for_go/)
- This is a core concept in Go’s type system; instead of designing our abstractions in terms of what kind of data our types can hold, we design our abstractions in terms of what actions our types can execute.
