# Go
Go is currently my favourite language.

I mostly love the tooling around it like VS Code and its [Go plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go). The powerful  `go` command line tool and the rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that people have built.

Go promotes composition over inheritance. 

## Commenting Go code
- Comments documenting declarations should be full sentences
- Comments should begin with the name of the thing being described and end in a period

## Snippets

## Notes
- I can call functions from anywhere if they are in the same package
- The package “main” tells the Go compiler that the package should compile as an executable program instead of a shared library
- Note that any type implements the empty interface interface{} because it doesn't have any methods and all types have zero methods by default
- Simply pushing my source code to GitHub, makes it `go get`table.
- Interface types represent fixed sets of methods
- the prevailing wisdom in Go is to use a flat directory structure and only create new directories when you are building self-contained functionality
