# Go
Go is currently my favourite language.

I mostly love the tooling around it like VS Code and its [Go plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go). The powerful  `go` command line tool and the rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that people have built.

Go promotes composition over inheritance. 

## Commenting Go code
- Comments documenting declarations should be full sentences
- Comments should begin with the name of the thing being described and end in a period

# Notes
- I can call functions from anywhere if they are in the same package
- The package “main” tells the Go compiler that the package should compile as an executable program instead of a shared library
