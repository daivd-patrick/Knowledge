# Julia libraries

## ML

- [Flux](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl) - Elegant approach to machine learning. It's a 100% pure-Julia stack, and provides lightweight abstractions on top of Julia's native GPU and AD support.
  - [Flux Model Zoo](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo)

## Math

- [DifferentialEquations](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl) - Julia suite for high-performance solvers of differential equations.
- [IterativeSolvers](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl) - Iterative algorithms for solving linear systems, eigensystems, and singular value problems.
- [JuMP](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl) - Modeling language for Mathematical Optimization (linear, mixed-integer, conic, semidefinite, nonlinear).

## Other

- [TimeSeries](https://github.com/JuliaStats/TimeSeries.jl) - Aims to provide a lightweight framework for working with time series data in Julia.
- [Plots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl) - Powerful convenience for Julia visualizations and data analysis.
