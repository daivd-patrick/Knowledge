# [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org)
A language I want to learn.

## Notes
- [Kinds are the types of types. Typeclasses are more like predicates or relations between types.](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/8cdiql/isnt_a_typeclass_just_a_type_of_a_type/)
- The fewer type parameters in a class, the better. Can you turn any into associated types? Can you split the class into two classes? Can you hive off some of the parameters into a superclass?
- Don't worry about strictness until it's time to optimise.
- Intuition about optimisation tends to be bad. Before profiling, limit yourself to reasoning about complexity classes.
- Don't judge haskell based on these definitions. They appear strange and crazy, but when you actually do stuff most of them turn out to be quite intuitive.
	- Advice is to ignore these things. Don't read a million monad tutorials. Just play around and code something, you don't have to understand the monad-definition before you can use the do-notation. Try to ignore them. After a while you get an intuition and then the definitions will make sense.
