# Finding work
I made a curated list of things to do and places to look to [find work](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/find-work#readme) programming.

Often the most effective way to apply is to apply directly. Go to the website of the company you want to apply to and see if there is a `Jobs` section present somewhere and apply through it. You can also send a direct email to the company's hiring management or if it's a startup, you can send an email to the Founder directly.

I use a similar message for all my direct emails:

```
Hey ..,

My name is Nikita, I saw you're looking for a .. at .. and I'd be interested in joining your team. I attached my CV for further information, let me know if you'd be interested in talking.

Thank you,
Nikita
```

Never let imposter syndrome or anything else stop you from applying to your dream jobs. Most requirements placed on the job boards are not set in stone. If you know how to learn fast and know things already that are related, apply! Don't let rejections discourage you, ever. It's a numbers game and the first jobs are always the hardest to get.

## Notes
- Sort by newest jobs in websites and check regularly and apply then.
