# Work
I never actually had an official job and finding work has always been quite frustrating. Being a _junior_ developer or student, it is incredibly hard to find your first programming related gig.

In any way, perhaps one day, someone will take a chance and hire me, until then all I can do is learn and make some projects of my own. And perhaps start my own thing one day.

## Notes
- [Nothing can help you change as fast as getting (positive or negative!) feedback. If you struggle it might be good to request something like a 360 feedback (anonymous feedback from direct colleagues on all layers of the hierarchy). See where you stand. Together with your manager figure out actions to remove the negative feedback and improve the positive, and act. In 6 months to a year do the same and see where you stand.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16802530)
