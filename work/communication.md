# Communication

## Notes

- [Never underestimate the impact of informal positive feedback on a junior, career-changer or someone new to the stack. Often people just need to know they're on the right road.](https://twitter.com/thomas_k_r/status/1296015993144332288)
- [At the end of each meeting ask if they know anyone else you can meet with. I normally tell them I’m trying to expand my network with successful folks in the area/space. Nice way to indirect compliment them.](https://twitter.com/AlwaysBeHustlin/status/1297920306900865024)
