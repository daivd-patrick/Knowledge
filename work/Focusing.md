# Focusing

Focusing on the things I need to be doing is quite hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

# Things that help me

I use [this app](https://heyfocus.com) to block a particular set of websites for 1 hour (website like Hacker News, Reddit). 

And I like to listen to some stimulating music. Lately I have been really liking listening [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzv0sfXDEGU).

Working outside from home and changing location often is also something helps me a lot being productive. 

I also realise that multiple monitors is not so helpful for me after all and I am quite productive with just one.
