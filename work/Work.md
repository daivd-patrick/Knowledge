# Work

I never actually had an official job and finding work has always been quite frustrating. Being a _junior_ developer or student, it is incredibly hard to find your first programming related gig.

In any way, perhaps one day, someone will take a chance and hire me, until then all I can do is learn and make some projects of my own. And perhaps start my own thing one day.
