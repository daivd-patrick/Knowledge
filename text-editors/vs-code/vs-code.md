# [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
My favourite editor that I use to write code in. Most notably I like its [Vim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim) and [Go](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go) plugins.

My config for it can be found [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/vscode/settings.json). And [here](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/6a477ff089612434d28258901d9d9e04) is a list of extensions I use.

I also love using [Ayu One Dark](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=faceair.ayu-one-dark) theme with [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font. Here is how it looks:
