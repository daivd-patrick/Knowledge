# [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode)
My favourite editor that I use to write code in. I use [many extensions](vs-code-extensions.md) for it.

My config for it can be found [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/vscode/settings.json).

I use [Alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/vscode-theme-alabaster) theme with [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) font. Here is how it looks:

## Notes
- [VS Code is architected in a way where extensions are not eagerly activated by default. Each extension can declare a list of activation events, such as e.g. opening a file of a certain language, invoking a specific command, starting debugging, etc.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16940419)
- `Developer: Show Running Extensions` command -> Shows currently running extensions. Is good for profiling.
