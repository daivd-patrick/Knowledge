# Emacs
Emacs is an interesting editor that I haven't really checked out still.

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/74hetz/emacs_everywhere/) paints a pretty interesting picture of what Emacs really is. It is a programmable user interface with which you can do many things. One of these things is editing text.

Might give it a go sometime.
