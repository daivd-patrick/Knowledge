# Research papers
I try to read various research papers related mostly to mathematics and computer science and programming as that is where my interests lie.  

If a paper is big enough and I have many notes, I will make a separate entry for it, if not I include it here. 

## [A view of mathematics](http://www.alainconnes.org/docs/maths.pdf)
 - The really fundamental point in that respect is that while so many mathematicians have been spending their entire scientiﬁc life exploring that world they all agree on its contours and on its connexity: whatever the origin of one’s itinerary, one day or another if one walks long enough, one is bound to reach a well known town i.e. for instance to meet elliptic functions, modular forms, zeta functions. “All roads lead to Rome” and the mathematical world is “connected”.
	- In other words there is just “one” mathematical world, whose exploration is the task of all mathematicians and they are all in the same boat somehow.
