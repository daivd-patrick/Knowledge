# [Open Source](https://opensource.guide)

The key to success in Open Source lies in understanding that it's not just about software, it's about the people.

## Notes

- Itâ€™s very hard to make open source work for products. multiple problems:
  1. How is it funded? could still make money from services, but makes it harder to integrate and sell. as a user, you should want this app to be around for the long run, and the best way to ensure that is to fund it directly.
  2. Open source doesnâ€™t guarantee long-term viability. itâ€™s extremely common in OSS that maintainers burn out, things start breaking, and there is a lot of churn (until it dies).
  3. While itâ€™s true that development might go quicker, a lot of the time the overhead of managing the open source workflow negates the wins. And sometimes the problem just takes a while to think about, no amount of throwing devs at it will help (this is the case for what Iâ€™ve been doing in the past several months. Actualâ€™s architecture for local data + syncing is unique and required careful thought). Open source works best for libraries in my experience. I think the best thing I could do is open-source parts of the apps as libraries, which would share the work and allow people to contribute back, while still allowing Actual itself to be carefully integrated.
