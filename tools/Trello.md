# Trello
I use the app a lot to track various ongoing things I have in my life.

## Notes
- You can attach link to card by simply selecting card and pressing `âŒ˜ + V`.
- In the date picker you can just type the number of the month to pick it. Or you can do `13/3` to make a due date for this year on March 13th.
