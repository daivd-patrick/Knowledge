# Dropbox
Dropbox is a pretty amazing service to share and keep files on the cloud. There is always privacy risks involved unless you put encrypted files in there but it is still undeniably great service.

I have a folder `shares` inside it where I put various files inside that I want to publicly share with people. I then use a modified version of [directory watches workflow](https://www.dropbox.com/s/kme10u2pycwcx1l/directory%20watches.alfredworkflow?dl=1) to scan through this folder from Alfred. I then modified one of the actions to on pressing `return` give me a shareable link of the file. Here is how that Alfred filter looks like for me :

It's pretty amazing as I can very easily query all the links I have shared with anyone. And I use it heavily to share files in this wiki itself.

For sharing files temporarily I use [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) and [Vitor's awesome Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/5233-uploadfile-%E2%80%94-upload-files-and-directories-for-easy-sharing/).
