# DuckDuckGo
Pretty amazing search engine that respects user's privacy.

I especially like its [instant answers](https://duckduckgo.com/api) feature.

## Awesome instant answers
- it has `tldr` integrated
	- so you can search for [tldr python](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=tldr+python+r%3Aus&ia=software) and it gives you a short summary of the command
	- there's also [explain shell](https://explainshell.com) for a more detailed overview
