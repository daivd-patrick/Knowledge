# Nutrition

One of those things where you know what is right for you but is still often hard to actually follow and do the right thing.

[This][1] book contains pretty much all you need to know to get you going with a proper nutrition plan as well why proper nutrition is important. The author also has a [website][2] where he blogs about various things nutrition and health.

As for myself, I like to follow these simple rules for eating my food :

1. no meat or dairy products
	- both for health reasons but mostly for [ethical reasons][3]
2. no extra sugar in the food
