# [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz)

Learn Anything is currently the main project I am working on.

There is a lot of interesting things that still have to be done and since the project is fully [open source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything), all the communication and discussions about this project are done in the open so anyone interested can join in and help.

There is a lot of information included in the [readme](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything#readme). And there are lots of [curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme) available that are open to contribution.

Aside from providing links and connected topics to learn from. The end goal is to create a machine learning system that understands what you know and what you want to learn. It can then craft the most optimized path for learning a thing X based on what you know. And that X can be anything. Bash, math, history, macOS.

A kind of Netflix for learning. And as its open source too, anyone who knows how to code can literally add a feature themselves. And if they don't like the direction in which the website is going, they can fork it away.

## Notes

- Can use [Stripe connect](https://stripe.com/gb/connect) to create a marketplace for LA.
- Can use [Aurora](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/) to host Postgres db.
- Can give in multiple subjects & LA crafts a guide for you taking into account subjects you already know (& skipping them?)
- Can use [LRMI specification](http://lrmi.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/lrmi_1/). It's collection of properties to describe educational resources.

## Possible Collaborations

- [ArtificialChat](https://artificial.chat) - Had a call with them (Paul Levy and main dev). Their stack is AWS heavy. LA can use its conversational bot

## Possible Funding

- [Syllabus 2.0 doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cc4sUSILFdjNC6AJvQai2XlA6c3UG0ccDfWcFPME7hc/edit)
- [USV Thesis 3.0](http://www.usv.com/blog/usv-thesis-30) - USV backs trusted brands that broaden access to knowledge, capital, and well-being by leveraging networks, platforms, and protocols. [Dani Grant](https://twitter.com/thedanigrant) is contact.
