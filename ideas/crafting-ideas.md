# [Crafting ideas](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas)
Crafting Ideas is a project I wish existed in this world.

The goal of the project is sharing ideas that a person has either privately for oneself or publically so that other people can help you make the project come alive.

This project should help tame my ever increasing list of ideas to do and make. I wish I could have a public profile of ideas that other people can look through and _steal_ or simply send a message and say they too wish this existed in the world. All that matters for me is that an idea manifests into this world somehow, it doesn't have to be made by me. It should hopefully help in making that wish come true.

For now I keep the ideas I want to build and make in a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/alB1ryRP).
