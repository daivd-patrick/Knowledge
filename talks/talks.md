# Talks
I love watching interesting talks on various subjects. I hope to give a few talks of my own one day.

I mark talks that I found interesting [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/talks).

## Notes
- Giving a talk, it sometimes helps to follow this order:
	1. Why?
	2. How?
	3. What?
- It is sometimes more powerful than the other way around.
