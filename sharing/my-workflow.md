# My workflow
My workflow is always changing but currently it consists of the following.

## Code
- VS Code - Main editor. Currently write mostly Go and Python.
- Sublime text - GitHub readmes, editing the wiki and quick edits (Markdown mostly).
- Neovim - Small and quick edits. Edit my Karabiner XML config file there.

## Task tracking
- 2Do - Personal day-to-day tasks. Every task is actionable. Tasks that don't fit into a GitHub issue are put there. Usually this includes personal tasks.
- Ship - GitHub issues. All issues I want to work on soon are put into `Up Next` queue and I work through each one, one by one.
- Trello - Public and personal boards. It's really nice because I can share pragmatically things I want to do publically and have the workflow actually be seamless so it doesn't distract or detach from the experience in any way.

## Time management
- Fantastical - I plan my work for the entire day ahead of me and my day is primarily guided by the events I create. I always have Fantastical show `Week` view for `5 days` from current day. This gives me a perspective on what deadlines I have soon to complete and I can adjust my events as necessary and plan accordingly.
- Timing - Track all time I spend there. I try to automate as much of the tracking as possible so Timing learns from what I do and it's easy to fill out the sections after.

## Knowledge Indexing
- This wiki - A bunch of markdown files rendered by [Gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com) and edited with Ulysses and Sublime Text.
- Articles on Medium - Share longer articles that serve to answer some one message or share some one insight there. This wiki is a more living and ever changing document.
- SnippetsLab - Snippets of code and knowledge (facts/reference).

## Bookmarks
- [LA curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki/Curated-Lists) - I open any of the lists readmes in seconds and any edit I make is automatically commited with Hazel. The lists are open to contribution too this way they get better and scale with time.
- Alfred My Mind -  All my public facing bookmarks. Searching this wiki here. Searching my articles, my GitHub repos and more.
- Safari and Chrome bookmarks - Only contain personal bookmarks. The rest is publically available and queriable by anyone.

## Photographs
- [Pixave](../macOS/apps/Pixave.md) - My entire media library of images and GIFs neatly sorted into collections. I post some images from there to my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/niikivi/).
- Apple Photos - All my personal photographs and images I made sorted into albums.
- Day One - Alongside small private notes and journal entries I add most photographs I take to Day One. Usually in form of `Travel` checkins. It's really awesome because everything there is encrypted and I can rely on it always being there.

## Journalling
- Day One - All my private thoughts and journal entries.
- [Looking back](../looking-back/looking-back.md) - My public log of things I've done and worked on throughout the months with highglights and comments on each month/year.

## News
- Reeder - I follow all blogs I am interested in with RSS.
- Tweetbot - I made many Twitter lists separated by topics.

## Social Media
- Covered what I use in [sharing](sharing.md) and [tracking](../sharing/tracking.md).

## Writing
- Ulysses - All my writing. Medium posts, stories, wiki, small pieces and ideas.

## Contacts
- Apple Contacts - All contacts and people I meet are added as contacts in my contacts book. All contacts are prefixed with a category (i.e. `f.` for `friend`) and most contacts have tags attached so it's easier to remember the person.
