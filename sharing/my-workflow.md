## Tech stack

- Websites - Use [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) to server side render sites in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react). Use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).
- Server APIs - Use [Go](https://golang.org/).
- Scripts & CLI tools - Use [Go](https://golang.org/).
- Database - Use [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) for everything. With [Hasura](https://hasura.io) setup for GraphQL queries. Use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) when need small DB.
- Mobile apps - Prefer to build iOS apps with native [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) & [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/). For apps that need cross platform support, I use [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
- Pick services from cloud providers where it makes sense. Solving problems is what matters. Tech used only matters to the extent that code should be maintainable and fast where needed.
- ML Models - Use [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).
