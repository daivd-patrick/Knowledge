# Sharing my work
I am currently focusing on working through [my projects](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/), [learning](../working-on/Learning.md) and sharing things I have learned and made.

Here are things I have made thus far and where you can find more about each of the things.

## [Code on GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev)
I like to solve problems I have with code and sharing the things I made on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev). I map all the repositories I shared as a map [here](https://my.mindnode.com/ZKGETDkUaQUsL3q8q9z788CxG84oEHgDiT79GuzX#49.4,-944.4,0).

I sometimes stream some of the things I am working on for fun on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/nikiivi). I try to explain things as I do them. 

## [Music on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/nikitavoloboev)
I am currently not writing any music of my own although I am learning. I do however share many of the songs I like in [form of playlists](../music/music-plays.md).

I also curate some [Imgur albums](https://nikivii.imgur.com) of various things.
