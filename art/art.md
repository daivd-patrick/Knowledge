# Art
At current time I am mostly a consumer of art rather than creator. I am working on changing that.

I like to collect various beautiful art pieces as an imgur album you can view [here](http://imgur.com/a/3m5wf). I also really like various [psychedelic art](http://imgur.com/a/9yOpt) and specifically I love [art by James R. Eads](http://imgur.com/a/Aao8R).

I share different photographs and art pieces I like on [my Instagram page](https://instagram.com/prettiways).
