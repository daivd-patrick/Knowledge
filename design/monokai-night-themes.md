# Monokai Night themes

After falling in love with using the original [Monokai Night theme for VS Code](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-monokai-night#readme), I started porting the look to other apps I use to have a similar look.

Having a unified color scheme across all the editors and even some apps I use is amazing.

## How it looks

So far this theme exists for these apps:

- [iTerm](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/iterm#readme)
- [Vim](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/vim-monokai-night#readme)
- [VS Code](https://github.com/fabiospampinato/vscode-monokai-night#readme)
