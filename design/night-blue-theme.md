# Night Blue themes
As I have fallen in love with having `#18222D` color as my background on Telegram. I slowly started added it to every app that supported theming. Having a unified color scheme across all the editors and even some apps I use is amazing.

So far this theme exists for these apps:
- [iTerm](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/iterm#readme)
- [Vim](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/night-blue-vim#readme)
- [VS Code](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/vscode-night-blue#readme)
- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/extras/theme/24fhXfBld7/)
- [Textual](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/textual#readme)
- [Ulysses](https://styles.ulyssesapp.com/bundle/Night+Blue/5b8573cd4f286f5c23d613d5)
