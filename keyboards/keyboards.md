# Keyboards
I love keyboards. Specifically I love remapping them with [Karabiner](../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md) to extend them to do more awesome things for me.

I am currently using Apple wireless keyboard and really love it. I love the low key travel as I get tired typing on most mechanical keyboards. The only thing I would change from that keyboard would be split space key into two keys for more remapping awesomness.

I am interested in other keyboards though. And might try some in the future.
