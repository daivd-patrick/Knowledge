# Keyboards

I love keyboards. Specifically I love remapping them with [Karabiner](../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md) to extend them to do more awesome things for me.

I am currently using Apple wireless keyboard and love it. I love the low key travel as I get tired typing on most mechanical keyboards. The only thing I would change from that keyboard would be split space key into two keys for more remapping awesomeness.

I am interested in getting [Preonic Light](https://www.massdrop.com/buy/massdrop-x-olkb-planck-light-mechanical-keyboard) keyboard with low profile Kailh switches. And I want to make it wireless too.

## Notes

- Gateron Browns low key travel mech switches seem nice.
