# Cryptography

## Notes

- [The megatrend in cryptography of the 2010s was elliptic curves, pairings and general purpose ZKPs/SNARKs. The megatrend of the 2020s will be (in addition to broad adoption of the above) lattices, LWE, multilinear maps, homomorphic encryption, MPC and obfuscation.](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1248704356758753281)
