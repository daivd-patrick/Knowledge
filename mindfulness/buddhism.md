# Buddhism
## Notes
- [Buddhism is a fantastic system that is really internally consistent and to our ability to prove it, accurate. Its primary axiom is that life as we know it is suffering, and builds a case for a universe from there that is primarily mental. It is from these observations, not pleas of faith, that the metaphysic is built up rather rationally. It behaves more like a science in many respects, with religious trappings that confuse the westerner. For example, one of the main tenets being skepticism: if you cannot prove what the Buddha stated then reject the model.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/7uefxp/trying_to_find_a_rational_metaphysical_perspective/)
