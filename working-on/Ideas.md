# Ideas
Until I have built [Crafting Ideas](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas), I may put some of my ideas I have here although I really should just sit down and build the project. It solves a __huge__ problem of mine.

## Workflows
- parse all [awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and read from Alfred
- parse all books from [free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) to Alfred
- index twitter following similar to [GitHub jump](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump)
	- see if there is API for that
- alfred travis interface
	- quickly scan my builds and get info on them
- parse arbitrary CSV files
	- similar to my [alfred edit files](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-edit-files) but instead of it reading one file, you pass in some CSV file instead and it will parse it to show in Alfred
		- can use that for many things
- index starred Gists and store in sqlite to read from Alfred 
- make workflows to quickly search through my entire Pixave library
- make workflow like [Safari Assistant](https://git.deanishe.net/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant) but for Chrome

## Web
- [Your life as little boxes](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/boxes)
	- a little website to show your life as little boxes 
	- in similar vein to [Alfred time](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-time) but visualise time passed and time passing
	- although it would be cool to extend this idea further and make these little blocks of time actionable in some way
		- or even make boxes represent something else and not time (like habits done)

## React components
- [markdown -\> CV](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/react-md-to-cv)
	- render markdown of information to a full fledged CV as a react component

## Fun
- create a fractal tree

## GitHub awesome lists
- awesome bookmarklets
