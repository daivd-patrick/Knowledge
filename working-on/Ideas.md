# Ideas
Until I have built [Crafting Ideas](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas), I may put some of my ideas I have here although I really should just sit down and build the project. It solves a __huge__ problem of mine.

Feel free to _steal_ and make any of them yourself. Ideas with 🍀 are ideas I am working on at this moment.

## Workflows
- [parse all awesome lists and read from Alfred](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-awesome-lists) 🍀
- index people I follow on GitHub for fast search 🍀
- parse all books from [free programming books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books) to Alfred
- index starred Gists and store in sqlite to read from Alfred 
- index twitter following similar to [GitHub jump](https://github.com/lox/alfred-github-jump)
	- see if there is API for that
- alfred travis interface
	- quickly scan my builds and get info on them
- parse arbitrary CSV files
	- similar to my [alfred edit files](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-edit-files) but instead of it reading one file, you pass in some CSV file instead and it will parse it to show in Alfred
		- can use that for many things
- Quickly search through my entire Pixave library
- Workflow like [Safari Assistant](https://git.deanishe.net/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant) but for Chrome
- Workflow to search through all my Facebook friends (if there is API for that)
- Workflow to search through Product Hunt collections (if there is API)
- Make a more robust version of [EggTimer](http://www.packal.org/workflow/eggtimer-2) workflow 

## Web
- [Your life as little boxes](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/boxes)
	- a little website to show your life as little boxes 
	- in similar vein to [Alfred time](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-time) but visualise time passed and time passing
	- although it would be cool to extend this idea further and make these little blocks of time actionable in some way
		- or even make boxes represent something else and not time (like habits done)
- [website to create custom learning paths for anything](https://github.com/learn-anything/path-picker)
	- a simple website with a search bar and a todo like list where the search bar searches over all the different topics you can learn about and users can create _recipes_ for learning anything they wish to learn about
		- i.e. one can make a _recipe_ to learn React.js that includes Javascript, then HTML or one can make a recipe to learn machine learning that includes linear algebra and then statistics where both of those topics can be split into more topics
		- and then you can share these _recipes_ with other people where the goal is to show what you think is the _most efficient_ path to learning some topic is 
		- and others users can then go through that path and learn each of the topics in [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) 

## React components
- markdown -\> CV
	- render markdown of information to a full fledged CV as a react component

## Fun
- create a fractal tree

## GitHub awesome lists
- awesome bookmarklets
