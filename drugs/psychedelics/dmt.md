## Notes
- [High dose of DMT. It'll be the closest thing to death without actually dying. What you realize is, on the other side of that threshold, a core piece of you will persist. Death is an illusion, consciousness exists forever/outside of time.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/7sec24/does_any_psychedelic_allow_you_to_make_peace_with/)
	- I think, to your point, all entheogens will help you (if you're ready for them), but a full fledged high blast of DMT, to quote Terrance McKenna, "is the farthest out one can go and still come back."
- [DMT is a funny drug, the more you take of it, the easier the trip becomes. It's these mid-range doses that are the worst. Reality is partially slipping away, and your ego, doing its job, is trying hard to grab a hold of what's left of it. You end up with a very anxious ego that thinks its about to die and a terrible trip.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMT/comments/7zqb5i/anyone_else_got_traumatized/)
- DMT refers specifically to dimethyltryptamine, a tryptamine molecule with two methyl groups on the N position. 5-MeO-DMT shares the same methyl groups but has an additional methoxy group on the 5 position creating an entirely different substance. It is not DMT.
