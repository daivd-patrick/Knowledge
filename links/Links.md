# Links
Underneath this folder are various files that essentially act as my own personal database of bookmarks. They are parsed to be read from Alfred but you can write a program to read the files and search them through any other program you use.

I use [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) to search through them. If you use it and like it, you are free to extend and add your own links to the files if you wish. Thank you.
