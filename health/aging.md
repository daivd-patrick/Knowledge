# Aging
Aging is a disease and thus can potentially be cured. For example, [Turritopsis dohrnii](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Turritopsis_dohrnii) jelly fish ages backwards.

## Notes
- [Curcumin](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Curcumin), [Pterostilbene](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pterostilbene) and [Nicotinamide riboside](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Nicotinamide_riboside) supposedly have anti aging properties.
