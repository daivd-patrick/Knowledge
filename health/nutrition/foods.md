# Foods

I exclude all foods that are not healthy and experiment with many [vegan recipes](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/vegan-recipes/#readme) from the many foods that are healthy. I follow a whole food, plant based diet.

Most of my diet consists of eating almonds, walnuts, blueberries, bananas and avocados. I try to eat a set of essential foods daily:

- Blueberries (200g+)
- Avocado (1+)
- Walnuts (50g+)
- Broccoli/Kale (50g+)
- Ginger (10g+) (add it to tea)

I use [Paprika app](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) to store all my recipes & the foods I can eat sorted into categories (with top first). Here is how it looks:
