# Nutrition
One of those things where you know what is right for you but is still often hard to actually follow and do the right thing.

[This book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663961-how-not-to-die?from_search=true) contains pretty much all you need to know to get you going with a proper nutrition plan as well why proper nutrition is important. The author also has a [website](https://nutritionfacts.org) where he blogs about various things nutrition and health.

As for myself, I like to [follow these simple rules](../../focusing/rules.md#nutrition) in regards to my nutrition.

## Notes
- Minimize high GI (glycemic index). It spikes blood sugar and insulin.
- Eat many healthy fats. Avocados, Flax seed oil, etc.
- Eat lots of high quality protein.
- [The “best” diet is a theme: an emphasis on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, and plain water for thirst.](http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/03/ultimate-conversation-on-healthy-eating-and-nutrition.html)
