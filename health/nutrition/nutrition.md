# Nutrition
[This book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663961-how-not-to-die?from_search=true) contains all the evidence needed to prove that a whole food, plant based diet is the best thing you can do to mitigate diseases and living a healthy life. The author also has a [website](https://nutritionfacts.org) where he blogs about various things nutrition and health.

Knowing this, I eat whole food, plant based diet with at least one salad every day. I take [few supplements](supplements.md) and I track all the [food I eat](foods.md) with [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/).

I only drink water, tea or coffee. No sugar in food/drinks. And I love exploring [new and interesting vegan recipes](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/vegan-recipes#readme).

## Notes
- Minimize high GI (glycemic index). It spikes blood sugar and insulin.
- Eat many healthy fats. Avocados, Flax seed oil, etc.
- Eat lots of high quality protein.
- [The “best” diet is a theme: an emphasis on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, lentils, nuts, seeds, and plain water for thirst.](http://www.grubstreet.com/2018/03/ultimate-conversation-on-healthy-eating-and-nutrition.html)
