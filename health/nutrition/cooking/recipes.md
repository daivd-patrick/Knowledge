# Food recipes
I want to find/build a good web front end that can import recipes I have created in [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com). Until then I'll share some recipes here.

Recips with a ðŸŒŸ are my favourite.

### Feta cheede & tomatoes salad ðŸŒŸ
Add chopped tomatoes and feta cheese together. Then add garlic, some salt with lemon and mix.

Really simple to make, has some calories due to feta cheese and tastes amazing. I also add it as a side dish often to other meals like salmon.
