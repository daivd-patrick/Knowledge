# Food recipes
I want to find/build a good web front end that can import recipes I have created in [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com). Until then I'll share some recipes here.

Recipes with ðŸŒŸ are my favourite.

### Feta cheese & tomatoes salad ðŸŒŸ
Add chopped tomatoes and feta cheese together. Then add garlic, some salt with lemon and mix. Feta cheese can optionally be swapped with mozzarella.

Really simple to make, has some calories due to feta cheese and tastes amazing. I also add it as a side dish often to other meals like salmon.
