# Food recipes
I want to find/build a good web front end that can import recipes I have created in [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com). Once I do that I'll post the recipes I have made there.

One recipe that I do like to make often is a simple Feta cheese & tomatoes salad. I also add garlic, some salt and lemon to it. Really simple to make, has some calories due to feta cheese and tastes amazing. I also add it as a side dish often to other meals like salmon.
