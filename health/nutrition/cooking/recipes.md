# Food recipes
I want to find/build a good web front end that can import recipes I have created in [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com). Until then I'll share some recipes here.

## Favourite
### Feta cheede & tomatoes salad
I add chopped tomatoes and feta cheese together. I then add garlic, some salt and lemon and mix.

Really simple to make, has some calories due to feta cheese and tastes amazing. I also add it as a side dish often to other meals like salmon.
