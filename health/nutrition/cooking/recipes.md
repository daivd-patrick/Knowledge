I want to find/build a good web front end that can import recipes I have created in [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com). Until then I'll share some recipes here.

### Salad with tomatoes, feta cheese and garlic (★★★★★)
Prep Time: 3 min | Servings: 1 | Difficulty: Easy

Ingredients:
Tomatoes
Feta cheese / Mozzarella
Garlic
Salt

Directions: Add chopped tomatoes and feta cheese together. Then add garlic, some salt with lemon and mix. Feta cheese can optionally be swapped with mozzarella.

Notes: Really simple to make, has some calories due to feta cheese and tastes amazing. Works well as a side dish to other meals like salmon.
