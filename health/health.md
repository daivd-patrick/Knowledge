# Health
I try to maximise my life satisfaction and quality of life through proper [nutrition](nutrition/nutrition.md), [exercise](../fitness/fitness.md) and no stress with [mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md).

## Improving my health
Here are some things I am trying to improve with my health right now.

### Posture
I spend the most of my conscious time near my computer for better or worse. Thus I try to be concsious of my posture at all times.

I once tried my own hacked version of a standing desk and loved it. One day, when I get some money, I would love to get a proper standing desk for myself.

### Nutrition
I cover nutrition in more depth [here](nutrition/nutrition.md).

### Stress
Stress shortens telomeres. Practicing [mindfulness](../mindfulness/mindfulness.md) helps greatly in maintaining a healthy and stress free outlook on life.

### Proper Sleep
Ideally going to sleep and waking up at the same time to keep the Circadian rhythm up. With ~ 7-8 hours of sleep each night.

### Dental care
Brushing my teeth every morning and evening as well as flossing it few times throughout the day.

The common theme here is _everything in moderation_.
