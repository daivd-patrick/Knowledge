# Countries
Countries I visited thus far in my life with some comments on them.

## [Netherlands](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Netherlands)
### [Eindhoven](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Eindhoven)
- The city I currently reside in and doing my CS BSc degree.
- Not very fond of the city as there is really nothing going on there or at least nothing that is of interest to me.

### [Amsterdam](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Amsterdam)
- Visited it quite a few times and loved it.

## [Cyprus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus)
### [Limassol](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Limassol)
- Has been my home town for a long time. Really loved the weather there and the sea.
