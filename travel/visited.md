# Visited
Countries and cities I visited thus far with some comments on them.

## Netherlands
### Eindhoven
- The city I currently reside in and doing my CS BSc degree.
- Not very fond of the city as there is really nothing going on there or at least nothing that is of interest to me.

### Amsterdam
- Visited it quite a few times and loved it.

## Cyprus
### Limassol
- Has been my home town for a long time. Really loved the weather there and the sea.
