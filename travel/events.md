# Events

I love meeting new people whether it be through traveling, attending events or having conversations with people online.

When attending an event, I usually add any person I found interesting to [contacts](../macOS/apps/contacts.md) tagging appropriately (i.e. the name of event we met at) and optionally adding them on Twitter/FB.
