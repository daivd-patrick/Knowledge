# Meeting people

I love meeting new people whether it be through traveling, attending events or having conversations with people online.

Best places to meet people are usually events of some kind.

I usually add any person I found interesting to [contacts](../macOS/apps/contacts.md) tagging appropriately (i.e. the name of event we met at or skill) and optionally adding them on Twitter/FB (have private `IRL` Twitter list).
