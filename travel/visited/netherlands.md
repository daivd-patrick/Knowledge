## Notes

- NS.nl [season tickets](https://www.ns.nl/en/season-tickets) are must have if you plan to travel more than a few times on the train in the month.
  - Dal Vrij (unlimited weekend + unlimited off peak hours) is great if you travel very often (i.e. work in one city and live in another).
  - Dal Voordeel (40 % discount on weekends + 40 % discount off peak) is good general discount.
