# Finance
For my own personal finance, I use [Actual](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/actual) budget app which I use it to track, budget and overview all of my finances.

I use [YNAB ideology](http://classic.youneedabudget.com/method) for managing my money with the goal of being proactive with budgeting and spending. Knowing how much money I have and how much money I can spend on any given category. I find this proactive approach in dealing with money very freeing and powerful.
