# Finance
For my own personal finance, I use [Actual](https://actualbudget.com/beta/) budget app which I use to track, budget and overview all of my finances.

I use [YNAB ideology](https://www.youneedabudget.com/method/) for managing my money with the goal of being proactive with budgeting and spending. Knowing how much money I have and how much money I can spend on any given category. I find this proactive approach in dealing with money very freeing and powerful.

Below are the categories I currently use in Actual:

## Notes
- FI is possible everywhere. The idea stays the same, save more than you spend, try generate passive income through stocks, dividends and property.
- [I think most people are going to mention credit cards in some way, but for me, it was how my actual bank accounts don't matter. It doesn't matter if I have $X in my savings and $Y in my checking account. I have $(X+Y) to budget and I need to budget $X for an emergency fund.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/908iob/what_was_the_hardest_part_of_ynab_for_you_to/)
	- Also, having $Z left over after budgeting doesn't mean I have $Z to blow. I have $Z to budget for next month since I already budgeted for my frivolous spending. That doesn't mean I don't just move $Z to something frivolous anyways.
