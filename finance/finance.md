# Finance
For my own personal finance, I use [Actual](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/actual) budget app which I use to track, budget and overview all of my finances.

I use [YNAB ideology](http://classic.youneedabudget.com/method) for managing my money with the goal of being proactive with budgeting and spending.

Below are the categories I currently use in [Actual](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/actual):
