# My mind

Aside from this wiki. I also heavily use and update my mind maps. There are many mind maps I have made and they are all connected in a way that makes sense to me. 

You can see all these mind maps I have made [here](https://my.mindnode.com/myLVaRLKytoTYBLshxGzzb75MN9cyGHbQBgaVVPp#1056.9,-8.3,-2).

# Why I made them

I use these mind maps for many things. Some maps I use to simply parse for link content like [this one](https://my.mindnode.com/QUvepUytUWtz3YY6owqvfNn1dvXZx3qHnSs9PWUz) for parsing various subreddits I frequently use. I can then instantly access any link from this map from my [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) workflow.

Which as the name suggests, acts as my second brain that I use to quickly access anything I have indexed for myself. I share it because I wish other people took this idea and made their own _Alfred My Mind_ or a _knowledge wiki_ but for their own use. Sharing knowledge and tools like that is very powerful and makes a big difference. As I use and reuse other people's work and knowledge many times a day. It never hurts to add to the mix.

But outside of parsing these maps for links for super fact access from Alfred. I also use these maps to actually stay sane with the immense amount of modifications and changes I have made in my life. Things like documenting my [Karabiner](macOS/karabiner/Karabiner.md) configuration.

That you can see live [here](https://my.mindnode.com/c7EmmKvaxCyCEuTzcpkGB4MGeLpWdR8nsJK4rjDh#2738.2,-4854.9,-3) and I explain it in more detail [here](macOS/karabiner/Karabiner.md).

I also use mind maps to keep my life in order with my own personal _projects_ mind map that looks like this :

I also use it to track things I am doing currently like tracking the [books I am reading now](https://my.mindnode.com/N7EYLDQWCsHKRLXadZKmvTwhr9P78ARYwZchG3mq#-49.6,-1462.4,2), [courses I am taking](https://my.mindnode.com/uXZqWxUQsXMGnzbjgjNccxsVGgtxA6d9RsM7NsHB) and a lot more. Essentially mind maps act as a digital augmentation of my mind in many ways. I want to visualise knowledge and thoughts and ideas I have and share most of these things with other people through this wiki, [the longer articles I write](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev), the [YouTube videos I make](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-youtube)  and of course finally through the code I write to make useful tools, apps and interactive visualisations that all can use and enjoy.

# How to use these mind maps

With all that said. The best way to know about me as a person, what I like and what I am into and what I am working on is to read through this wiki. With time, it will contain essentially everything that I know _in my own words_. 

This wiki acts as a first class citizen and anything that I ultimately want to share or have shared will be written down here, somewhere. Most of the mind maps I have made will be linked to from here and will have some description of the map too.

# Future

There are many, many things I am yet to add to this little system I am planning to make. I am still trying to find the perfect balance of how my knowledge, projects, thoughts and ideas and programmes and code should be structured but my goals with both this wiki, my mind maps are : 

1. fast access to all this knowledge base  
	- achieved through 
		- alfred my mind 
			- which will soon be rewritten in Go and be a lot more powerful
		- this knowledge wiki itself and the search it has
2. transcribing knowledge in terms that make sense to me and other people
	- I wish to make my knowledge and expertise as _reusable_ by as many other interested people as possible
