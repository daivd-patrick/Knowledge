# Abbreviations ðŸ”–
I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean : 
- LA = [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) (will often link to a map from there for learning some topic)
- km = [keyboard maestro](../macOS/apps/km/km.md)
- repo = GitHub repository

# Prefixes
I also can prefix certain things with a year, like in [talks](../talks/Talks.md) which stand for they year in which the article or book was made in.

# Karabiner mappings
I may often say something like `which I binded to a + k` which means I binded some action with Karabiner to `a` modifier key held down + k. For what means, you can read [this](../macOS/apps/karabiner/Karabiner.md).
