# Wiki reference
Since I am both releasing this wiki for other people to read and explore as well as for my own use. I have a small number of _rules_ of things I follow. If you stumble upon anything confusing in the wiki, this place should ideally clear up any question you had.

## Abbreviations
I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean : 
- LA = [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) (will often link to a map from there for learning some topic)
- KM = [Keyboard Maestro](../macOS/apps/km/km.md)
- repo = GitHub repository

## Emojis
Instead of writing `TODO:` across this wiki, I use ðŸ“Œ emoji to mean the same thing. So if you see something with ðŸ“Œ next to it, just dismiss it as it is for my own personal use and reference.

## GitHub Gists
As I embed a lot of code in these wiki as gists. I use `{}` to signify user input in these Gists. [Here](https://gist.github.com/17a9bc95ce5da0db7f85d076b45d07cd) is an example of one such gist. There `{dir}` means that a directory name is the user command that is missing.

## Years
I often add a year in brackets to some articles or talks like `(2017)` which stands for the year in which that article or talk was given in.

## Karabiner mappings
I may often say something like `which I binded to a + k` which means I binded some action with Karabiner to `a` modifier key held down + k. For what means, you can read [this](../macOS/apps/karabiner/Karabiner.md).
