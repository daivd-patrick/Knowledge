# Wiki reference
Since I am both releasing this wiki for other people to read and explore as well as for my own use. I have a small number of _rules_ of things I follow. If you stumble upon anything confusing in the wiki, this place should ideally clear up any question you had.

## Abbreviations
I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean : 
- LA = [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) (will often link to a map from there for learning some topic)
- KM = [Keyboard Maestro](../macOS/apps/km/km.md)
- repo = GitHub repository

## Years
I often add a year in brackets to some articles or talks like `(2017)` which stands for the year in which that article or talk was given in.

## Karabiner mappings
I may often say something like `which I binded to a + k` which means I binded some action with Karabiner to `a` modifier key held down + k. For what means, you can read [this](../macOS/apps/karabiner/Karabiner.md).
