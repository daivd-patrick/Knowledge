Studies computation.

What is computation and what is computable is actually quite fascinating. Apparently not all things are computable as was proved by Alan Turing with the Halting problem.

Lambda Calculus is also something really interesting as it tries to define computation symbolically from what I understand. I still am yet to really understand it and Haskell + all the rich functional programming ecosystem. There is quite a lot out there, really.
