# Games
I kind of stopped playing games after I got my Mac.

Although I have really loved spending my time playing Warcraft 3 and its multitude of awesome mods, WOW, Diablo II, Heroes of Might and Magic III, League of Legends and many other ones.

I don't regret the time I spent playing these games and I have learned a lot from them. In some way, my love for optimising and streamlining my workflow has come from these games where you can get immediate reward for things you do and where the rules you have to follow and the end goals you have are more obvious.

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/EekGabpj) of games I am playing now or want to play.
