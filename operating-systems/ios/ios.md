# iOS

My [favorite mobile operating system](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme) mostly due to me not really trying anything else.

I hope to release Learn Anything on iOS soon too. That would be quite cool.

## Notes

- [Giving location, camera, photo permissions to apps matters](https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-watchuser-access-both-iphone-cameras-any-time-your-app-is-running)
- To unlock watch with iOS: Watch.app > Passcode > Unlock with iPhone.
- If you want to find text on a page in Safari, you can click the URL bar, type the word that you want, and select the last option “On this page”.
- [Can edit Scriptable snippets on mac with VS Code with instant syncing to iOS](https://talk.automators.fm/t/code-editing-on-the-mac/2005)
- [Use debugger and breakpoints for debugging. There are also some button in the debugger that are helpful. The one with the rectangles button suspends your app and allows you to visually see the layers of the current screen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/ae2h6e/what_ios_development_habits_do_you_wish_you/)
  - You can also use Accessibility Inspector for detecting elements and their values.
  - You can also hit the play/pause button in the debugger to pause the app. You can also use commands in the debugger while paused. For example, if you wanted to know a value of a variable, you can type “po varName” and it will print it. Or if it’s a class, you can access properties.
  - You can also create exception breakpoints to print out “po \$arg1” and it will print the reason it crashed at the bottom of the stack trace so you don’t have to scroll up.
- It’s useful to setup apps to open links in Safari and not in-browser where possible (i.e. Tweetbot)
- [To share purchased content, all family members must be on the same country or region.](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201454)
