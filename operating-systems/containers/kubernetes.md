# [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
## Notes
- Kubernetes runs pods that contain 1 to n docker containers. So if you have your apps in the form of docker images you are ready to go.
- [The Openshift guys like make the analogy that Kubernetes is like Linux and that there are different distributions of it, openshift being one (like Red Hat).](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/94n994/for_those_of_you_who_use_kubernetes_how_the_hell/)
