The Internet is genuinely one of the best things to come out of 20th century. It has so many implications for the future and can solve so many of the world's problems, it is exciting.

I am still exploring how the underlying web technologies work although the networking stack that makes this all possible is quite complex. All the different protocols, it's a wonder how people came up with it all.
