# Safari

My favourite browser for many reasons. It is incredibly fast, doesn't have the baggage of all the Google Chrome tracking and is native to macOS so it is extremely optimised.

# Safari power using

I use [this amazing workflow](https://git.deanishe.net/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant) by Deanishe to quickly jump between my currently active Safari tabs as well as search through my history and my bookmarks.

I am also using a lot of extensions which can be found [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/safari-extensions).
