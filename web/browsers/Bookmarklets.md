# Bookmarklets
I run my bookmarklets from KM like so :

Here are the bookmarklets I use : 
- [go to first commit of currently open repo](https://gist.github.com/ada36ad5c440246c60c2833308c2cf1d)
- [online article discussion finder](https://github.com/theoretick/discuss-it)
	- lets you see where the link you are watching right now has been discussed before

# Notes
- you can add bookmarklets in Safari either by 
	- dragging a bookmarklet from a webpage to your bookmarks bar then moving it from there
	- creating a random bookmark, then editing it and changing the URL to the bookmarklet JavaScript
