# [Stylus](https://userstyles.org)
I prefer to use darker interfaces on most websites I use so I change the looks of many websites with Stylus.

I plan to rewrite [Safari Stylish](http://sobolev.us/stylish/) so it works on Safari 12.0

And I use [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) on Chrome instead of Stylish as the latter [collects websites you visit](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/).

Below are themes I love using with it.

I also use [WikiWand](http://www.wikiwand.com) as my wiki dark mode:

In the cases where there doesnâ€™t exist a Stylish theme for a website, I sometimes use [Nightlight Safari extension](https://gofake1.net/projects/nightlight.html) to have all websites have night mode with a toggle on/off switch. It works surprisingly well and helps when using the internet at night.
