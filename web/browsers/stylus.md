# [Stylus](https://userstyles.org)
I prefer to use darker interfaces on websites during evenings. So I change the looks of many websites with Stylus.

I plan to rewrite [Safari Stylish](http://sobolev.us/stylish/) so it works on Safari 12.0 if no one else does it.

I don't use Chrome/Firefox much but I use [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#readme) there instead of Stylish as the latter [collects websites you visit](https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/02/stylish-browser-extension-steals-your-internet-history/).

Below are themes I like using with it.

Even though I prefer using [Dictionary app](https://wokabulary.com/blog/the-built-in-dictionary-on-mac-and-iphone.html) I also use [WikiWand](http://www.wikiwand.com) extension for the web which has dark mode:

In the cases where there doesnâ€™t exist a Stylus theme for a website, I sometimes use [Nightlight Safari extension](https://gofake1.net/projects/nightlight.html) to have all websites have night mode with a toggle on/off switch. It works surprisingly well and helps when using the internet at night.
