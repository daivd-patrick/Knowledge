# [Safari](https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/)
My favourite browser for many reasons. It is incredibly fast, doesn't have the baggage of all the Google Chrome tracking and is native to macOS so it is extremely optimised.

Here are the websites I have in my `Favourites` which are usually sites I want super fast access to from iOS Safari:

## Safari power using
As it is my most used app, I like to script and automate as much of my use of it as possible.

I open any of my most used websites using [these KM macros](https://goo.gl/3PzcX9). The macro opens the website I specify or if the website is open anywhere in Safari and will jump between the tabs of the website. I use this macro for my most used websites and I can open any website I wish with a single keypress. Both open and switch between various websites.

Aside from it, I use [many Safari extensions](https://github.com/learn-anything/safari-extensions#readme). Most notably I love and recommend using [sVim](https://github.com/flipxfx/sVim). My configuration for it can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/c26e6a05e4e426e0542e55b7513b581c).

I also use [this amazing workflow](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant) to quickly jump between my currently active Safari tabs as well as search through my history and my bookmarks.
