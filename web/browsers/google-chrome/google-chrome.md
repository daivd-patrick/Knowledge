# [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

I use it to develop websites with Dev Tools, [Pesticide](http://pesticide.io) & [React Dev Tools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html) extensions.

I use dark mode & [Empty New Black Tab Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/empty-new-tab-page-black/fllomkdgoahjlgcblpldnpjcilipjelp?hl=en).
