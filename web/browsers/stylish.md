# [Stylish](https://userstyles.org)
I prefer to use darker interfaces on most websites I use so I change the looks of many websites with Stylish.

Below are themes I love using with it. You can download and import all these themes into both [Safari](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s07fprfjfwrmuqn/stylish-safari.dms.txt?dl=1) and [Chrome](https://www.dropbox.com/s/qgj43qc66yo2rhy/stylish-chrome.dms?dl=1).

Download and import them into [Safari Stylish](http://sobolev.us/stylish/) and [Chrome Stylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) extensions respectively.

I also use [Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com) as my wiki with dark mode:

In the cases where there doesnâ€™t exist a Stylish theme for a website, I sometimes use [Nightlight Safari extension](https://gofake1.net/projects/nightlight.html) to have all websites have night mode with a toggle on/off switch. It works surprisingly well and helps when using the internet at night.
