I prefer to use darker interfaces on most websites I use so I change the looks of many websites with Stylish.

Here are themes I love using with it.

I also use [Wikiwand](http://www.wikiwand.com) as my wiki with dark mode:

In the cases where there doesnâ€™t exist a Stylish theme for a website, I sometimes use [Nightlight Safari extension](https://gofake1.net/projects/nightlight.html) to have all websites have night mode with a toggle on/off switch. It works surprisingly well and helps when using the internet at night.
