# Static sites
I love using [Hugo](hugo.md) for generating static websites. I then use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to host the sites for free.

## Interesting generators
- [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) - Using React.

## Links
- [The Intrinsic Static Site](https://brandur.org/aws-intrinsic-static)
- [Going static](https://brandur.org/fragments/going-static)
