# Ad blocking

## Links

- [PI-HOLE](https://pi-hole.net/) - Network-wide ad blocking via your own Linux hardware. It doesn’t only hide ads, it blocks the connection between your network and the domains you blacklist completely. You set the IP of your Raspberry Pi running Pihole as your DNS server and that’s it. It comes preconfigured with a lot of blacklisted domains, but there are tons of lists you can add to block even more.
