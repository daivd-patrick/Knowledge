# Privacy
I try to be aware of my digital fingerprint on the Internet. Who owns the data I create and the data traces I leave.

I made a [small repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting#privacy-respecting) to share all the various alternatives to popular often centralised and _free_ services that are available. And I wrote a [small article](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/like-a-dog-on-a-leash-c0cdb8839079) with some of my thoughts on the matter.

## Notes
- [Facebook is not a private nor a secure platform for sharing sensitive information. Every character that you type into their text boxes is immediately parsed and sent to their servers, regardless of whether you actually complete a post and submit it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/79x7u3/facebook_employees_just_opened_a_privately_shared/)
