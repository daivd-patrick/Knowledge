# Privacy

I try to be aware of my digital fingerprint on the Internet. Who owns the data I create and the data traces I leave.

I made a [repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting) to share all the various alternatives to popular often centralized and _free_ services that are available. And I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/like-a-dog-on-a-leash-c0cdb8839079) with some of my thoughts on the matter.

I use [Hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts) and [Wipr](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/wipr/id1320666476?l=en&mt=12) for both mac & iOS to limit tracking.

And I have deep interest in [Differential privacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_privacy) and [Homomorphic encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption).

## Notes

- [Facebook is not a private nor a secure platform for sharing sensitive information. Every character that you type into their text boxes is immediately parsed and sent to their servers, regardless of whether you actually complete a post and submit it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/79x7u3/facebook_employees_just_opened_a_privately_shared/)
- Marketing most importantly is about establishing wants that you didn't have.
