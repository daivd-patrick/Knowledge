# Privacy
I try to be aware of my digital fingerprint on the Internet. Who owns the data I create and the data traces I leave.

I made a [small repository](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/privacy-respecting) to share all the various alternatives to popular often centralised and _free_ services that are available. And I wrote a [small article](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/like-a-dog-on-a-leash-c0cdb8839079) with some of my thoughts on the matter.

Lately, however I am focusing on getting things done and using the best tools at my disposal to fix the problems I have at hand.
