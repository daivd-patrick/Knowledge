# [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
Homebrew is an awesome package manager for macOS supported by community. Brew packages I have installed with it can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/3fbe13ce427132d0297f411b62f49034).

I am however trying to move to [nix](nix.md) as my main package manager as it has many benefits that brew does not have.

# Notes
- Should run `brew cleanup` once in a while to clean off things.
- Brew installs programmes into `/usr/local/bin`.
