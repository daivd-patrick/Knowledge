# Lessons learned
## Life
- Prioritise 
	- do the important things first
		- define these _important_ things for myself and be clear with what I want to achieve
- Automate backups
	- make sure the backups you’ve made are actually successful
- Study smart
	- ask yourself the question of what it is I am trying to solve or understand
	- start working to solve the problems before the deadline
		- and __prioritise__
- Move fast
	- ask questions whenever you don’t understand
	- don’t sit idly
- Focus
	- focus is the ability to say __no__ to things
- Write more
	- document my thoughts and findings and share it
	- research really well the topic you are trying to share
	- make sure I don’t repeat what has been said before and if it was 
		- link to it and make my own observations and conclusions
- Track my expenses
- get into the flow state as early as possible during the day
- just being exposed to concepts through videos or tutorials is not going to help me pass interviews
	- actually code everything up and implement it
- don’t be careless on the exams and when doing exercises
	- check back on your work and go through your calculations
	- it is very easy to miss something
- sit up right
	- your body language dictates how you feel
	- sit straight and don’t slouch your back
- drink water
	- always stay hydrated
- pay attention to my health and well being
	- do not consume excess sugar
- learn by investigation
	- rather than by consuming some data points
	- that is __strive to understand__
		- why 
		- and how
- use paper
	- don’t be full digital and try out my calculations and thinking on paper
- read documentation
	- it saves a lot of time
- keep receipts of expensive purchases
	- you never know what happens and a lot of more expensive items have warranty
- specialise
	- don’t jump at everything and try to know it all
	- be really great at one thing and then you can branch out
- check everything once you leave a room
	- did I forget anything?
- learn from my mistakes
	- be conscious of mistakes that I have already done
	- learn why they happened and do my best to never repeat them again
- look at the price of the delivery
- [don’t assume it’s difficult until it is](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10872970)
- simplicity matters
	- don't overcomplicate things for no reason
- try to avoid confusion as much as possible
	- don't use anything only you can understand and release it in the public
- Ask questions
	- asking questions is a a great thing and being stuck on the same problem or being oblivious how to do some thing is not always a great thing
	- be wary of how to [ask questions the right way](../research/asking-questions.md) though

## Code
- use switch cases over long ifs
- it’s a lot easier to actually just use one screen
	- much easier to context switch
- use version control
	- and commit your changes
	- it is a pain to reverse and fix things when you don't know where the problem is
	- do __atomic__ commits
- write proper commit messages
- comment over my code!
	- especially zsh functions, makes things easier to read

## Using Mind maps
- don’t index information for the sake of indexing
	- try to see how this piece of knowledge plays a role in on a more higher level
- be smart about how to present information in the mind maps
	- it should be more of a guide and a glue between different things rather than as a way to dump everything in one single file

## Productivity
- use the right tool for the job
	- i.e. mind maps are great for visualising things so don't use them to dump things inside to filter for things
	- you can use simple markdown and text files for that where it is easier to maintain and extend

## Other
- when proposing feature requests, _"for me"_ is never a good argument for a feature request
	- if you want someone to add a feature to their software, show how it would be useful to lots of users
