# Psychedelics
Exploring my mind has always been one of the most interesting things in life for me.

Exploring different states of consciousness both naturally or chemically induced. There is a certain sense of mystery how one chemical can radically change your perception in such a short time and leave you with more questions than you started with.

Sadly, there is a rather negative stigma attached to most illegal drugs. It's sad that drugs like alcohol that numb your senses and your perception are socially acceptable yet drugs that let you explore and see things in a new light are banned and frowned upon.

On the brighter side, I think things are changing and are getting better in this regard. With advent of such easy access to knowledge, it is not so hard to do one's own research and come to one's own conclusions instead of accepting what other people think or say.

But as will all things, _moderation is key_. Or as in the case with psychedelics, this Alan Watts quote:

> _"When you get the message, hang up the phone"_

## Notes
- [I believe that everything is the creator. People and animals are the creator looking through different eyes.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/7811jc/have_psychedelic_experiences_changed_your_view_of/doq5ia1/)
	- Psychedelics made me realise how intricate reality really is. They added this thought that maybe thereâ€™s something more real than real.
- The spiritual perspective, at least from the point of view of Buddhism/Sufism/Daoism (and many others), is that it is inside of you. Except that you is completely different than what you've been taught.
	- There is only one being in all of existence. You. Everything is you. Humans are small parts that exist within you in the same way that cells are smaller parts that exist within the human body.
	- I am you. The beings you meet are you. God is you.
		- This is exactly what DMT reveals if you go deep enough. It's even more directly experienced with 5meo-dmt, but substances are not even necessary for the realization. Meditation will bring you there, eventually.
- [Psychedelics can make anything seem meaningful even if it's something pointless, similar to how cannabis can make you satisfied with boredom, opiates can make you relaxed in any situation, stims can give you confidence, etc. Relying on any drugs to give you meaning or whatever makes you a slave to them and in the end the only way you really get something is working for it, not just doing psychedelics and thinking about how meaningful something is.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/7b7kxu/how_have_psychedelics_changed_your_life_if_at_all/)
- [Drug induced enlightenment is not enlightenment at all, I'm not sure what the mechanism is, but it feels like a different version of ecstacy. You take it, you overload your brain with serotonin, feel wonderful and connected, and then it's gone. I think psychedelics do the same with whatever chemical gets released in much smaller amounts when we figure something out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/4whrnx/i_did_so_much_acid_i_almost_died/d67p6sd/ "permalink")
