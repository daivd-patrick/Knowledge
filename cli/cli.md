# Command Line Interface

I use many CLI tools and I document all the commands and aliases I use [here](https://my.mindnode.com/upnFQeGrQCPwgCf3pfS4FgywQUj5sXNLxb1awm1D). 
  
I also made a few of my own tools :

- [license up](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/license-up) 
	- use it to quickly make and add a license file to my projects
- [md to alfred](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/md-to-alfred)
	- converts a markdown of very specific format to Alfred 
	- I am writing a more robust solution for this soon
