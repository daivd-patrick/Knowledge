# Command Line Interface
I use many CLI tools and I document all the commands and aliases I use [here](https://my.mindnode.com/upnFQeGrQCPwgCf3pfS4FgywQUj5sXNLxb1awm1D). 
  
## CLI actions
- [list all processes running](https://gist.github.com/3fa57243dbfbdfb422555b28c89ab650)
- [create symbolic link](https://gist.github.com/ca5c6ab63631309e54d251bc4e150bc9)
- [copy content of entire file to clipboard](https://gist.github.com/4fcd2cea9d9b34f25d446193bc3e0f02)
- [give executable permission to file](https://gist.github.com/b0c07c968c528be61fceff833a504bbe)

## CLI commands (small ones, bigger ones have their own entry)
- [kill](https://gist.github.com/763b973f7ffd884bf2e85da4d2a40213)


## My own tools
I also made a few of my own tools :
- [license up](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/license-up) 
	- use it to quickly make and add a license file to my projects
- [md to alfred](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/md-to-alfred)
	- converts a markdown of very specific format to Alfred 
	- I am writing a more robust solution for this soon
