# Podcasts
I love listening to podcasts especially when commuting or travelling somewhere.

My favourite podcasts currently are [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm) and [StackTrace](https://stacktracepodcast.fm/).

I would love to make my own podcast one day if I find something interesting to talk about.

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Wtr04eGQ) of podcasts I am listening and want to listen to.
