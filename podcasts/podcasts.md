# Podcasts
I love listening to podcasts with [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) especially when commuting or travelling somewhere.

My favourite podcasts currently are [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm), [StackTrace](https://stacktracepodcast.fm/) and [Tim Ferris Show](https://overcast.fm/itunes863897795/the-tim-ferriss-show).

I would love to make my own podcast one day once I find something interesting to talk about.

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Wtr04eGQ) of podcasts I am listening and want to listen to.
