# [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com)
Day One is my digital life journal.

I mostly use it to write my [Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e#.m4lw1eo32) evaluating my day and noting interesting and memorable things that have happened to me during the day. 

I also log and archive automatically my tweets and Instagram posts using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/day_one).
