# [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com)
Day One is my digital life journal.

I mostly use it to write my [Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e#.m4lw1eo32) evaluating my day and noting interesting and memorable things that have happened to me during the day. 

I also log and archive automatically my tweets and Instagram posts using [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/day_one). 

## My Journals
### Photo a Day
I make a picture of me every day and put it in the journal. Often doing it a new and different place and saying how I feel about the day. I want to do a collage of these pictures in the future.

### Evaluation
Weekly evaluation and self reflection. I use [Timing](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en) and [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/dashboard) for this see through these tools where I spent my time and where I can do better.

### Life
Writing about my life in a more open and free way. If something memorable happened to my life or I've been through something or want to say something, I write it there.

### Travel
Documenting my travel experiences. Tagging entries by country and geo tagging every entry. I also use tags like `new city` or `new country` or `new ..` often. I also use Swarm app for checkins of various places.

### Dreams
My dream journal. I want to lucid dream and to do that you need to remember your dreams. You also need to get into the habit of making reality checks. I write about my dreams briefly in this journal and note down common themes about them, if any.

### Autolog
I use [IFTTT](../../tools/IFTTT.md) to automatically post my public activity from Twitter / Instagram / Facebook to this journal. Since I do want to lead a more open life, I very often post in the public outlets and share my experiences there so I want to have those experiences in Day One together with my more private memories. 

### Feelings
Contains very short entries. If I am feeling sad or happy about something, I write a small entry and say what I feel and put it there. It helps me be more conscious and honest with myself, my thoughts and feelings. 

### Progress
In similar vein to `Evaluation`. I try to track and be more conscious about my physical progress in me trying to become a stronger version of me physically. I post my progress pictures and my own commentary and thoughts there.

### Family
I also have a dedicated journal where I put all the memories I have shared with my family.
