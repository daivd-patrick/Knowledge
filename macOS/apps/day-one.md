# [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com)
Day One is my digital life journal.

My entire life's experiences lives encrypted in the journal. Adding photographs I made and the thoughts and events that happened to me.

I document and review [my life](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/looking-back/looking-back.html) publicly too.

The app has integration with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/day_one) which I use to automatically log all [my tweets](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) and [Insgragram posts](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/).

If you don't journal, I suggest you to start, it is a very powerful mind cleanser and acts as a wonderful history record of your life.

I started with journalling by writing [Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e#.m4lw1eo32), evaluating my day and noting interesting and memorable things that have happened to me during the day.

Since then however, I adopted a more open approach to documenting my memories and life in a way that doesn't stop me from being in the moment and just enjoying things and experiences.

I am very open to the public sharing both the things I know and like and also the different little things that happen to me, so I use [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/day_one) to log and archive my public activity from Instagram and Twitter into Day one.

## My Journals
### Photo a Day
I make a picture of me every day and put it in the journal. Often doing it a new and different places and saying how I feel about the day. I want to do a collage of these pictures in the future. Sometimes I put more than one photo there. The idea is that I can replicate what happened to me from that day just from the photos.

### Travel
Day One has a pretty awesome `activity stream` feature where it tracks the places you have been and visited to across your day and you can `check in` into those places and add some photos or comments to go alongside these check ins. I use this a lot and I especially love looking back at all the places I've been to and things I've done over time later by exploring Day One map.

I also love tagging entries by country and geo tagging every entry. And I use tags like `new city` or `new country` or `new ..` often.

### Life
Writing about my life in a more open and free way. If something memorable happened to my life or I've been through something or want to say something, I write it there.

### Dreams
My dream journal. I want to lucid dream and to do that you need to remember your dreams. You also need to get into the habit of making reality checks. I write about my dreams briefly in this journal and note down common themes about them, if any.

### Evaluation
Weekly evaluation and self reflection. I use [Timing](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en) and [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/dashboard) for this and see through these tools to know how I spent my time and where I can do better.

### Autolog
I use [IFTTT](../../tools/ifttt.md) to automatically post my public activity from Twitter / Instagram / Facebook to this journal. Since I do want to lead a more open life, I very often post in the public outlets and share my experiences there so I want to have those experiences in Day One together with my more private memories.

### Feelings
Contains very short entries. If I am feeling sad or happy about something, I write a small entry and say what I feel and put it there. It helps me be more conscious and honest with myself, my thoughts and feelings.

### Progress
In similar vein to `Evaluation`. I try to track and be more conscious about my physical progress of me trying to become a stronger version of me physically. I post my progress pictures and my own commentary and thoughts there.

### Family
I also have a dedicated journal where I put all the memories I have shared with my family.
