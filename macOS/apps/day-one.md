# [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com)

Day One is my digital life journal.

My entire life's experiences lives encrypted in the journal. Adding photographs I made and the thoughts and events that happened to me.

I document and review [my life](../../looking-back/looking-back.md) publicly too.

The app has started integrating with different services. Currently only Instagram. Hopefully soon Twitter. I love Day One for it's ability to centralize all my life's experiences into one place. Powered by search and amazing `On this Day` feature.

If you don't journal, I suggest you to start, it is a very powerful mind cleanser and acts as a wonderful history record of your life.

I started with journaling by writing [Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e#.m4lw1eo32), evaluating my day and noting interesting and memorable things that have happened to me during the day.

Since then however, I adopted a more open approach to documenting my memories and life in a way that doesn't stop me from being in the moment and just enjoying things and experiences.

## My Journals

### Life

Private observations & memorable experiences. I share most everything I do on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/nikitavoloboev).

### Dreams

My dream journal. I want to lucid dream and to do that you need to remember your dreams. You also need to get into the habit of making reality checks. I note down memorable dreams I had briefly in this journal paying attention to common themes across all my dreams, if any.

### Family

Contains all the memories I shared with my family.

### Instagram

Day One has native integration with Instagram with full upload of all posts + descriptions.

## Looking back

Besides Day One, I lead a more open diary and monthly overviews in [Looking back](../../looking-back/looking-back.md).
