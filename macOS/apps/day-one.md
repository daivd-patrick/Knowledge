# [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com)
Day One is my digital life journal.

My entire life's experiences lives encrypted in the journal. Adding photographs I made and the thoughts and events that happened to me.

I document and review [my life](../../looking-back/looking-back.md) publicly too.

The app has integration with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/day_one) which I use to automatically log all [my tweets](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) and [Instagram posts](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/).

If you don't journal, I suggest you to start, it is a very powerful mind cleanser and acts as a wonderful history record of your life.

I started with journaling by writing [Day Evaluations](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e#.m4lw1eo32), evaluating my day and noting interesting and memorable things that have happened to me during the day.

Since then however, I adopted a more open approach to documenting my memories and life in a way that doesn't stop me from being in the moment and just enjoying things and experiences.

I am very open to the public sharing both the things I know and like and also the different little things that happen to me, so I use [IFTTT](../../tools/ifttt.md) to log and archive my public activity from Instagram and Twitter into Day One.

## My Journals

### Life
Writing about my life in a more open and free way. If something memorable happened to my life or I've been through something or want to say something, I write it there.

I also try and make a photograph of me every day. Often doing it a new and different places. I want to do a collage of these pictures in the future. Often I put more than one photo there. The idea is that I can replicate what happened to me from that day just from the photos.

### Travel
I document my travel experiences there. For travel checkins I use [Swarm](https://www.swarmapp.com). And I make lists of places I liked on Foursquare.

### Dreams
My dream journal. I want to lucid dream and to do that you need to remember your dreams. You also need to get into the habit of making reality checks. I write about my dreams briefly in this journal and note down common themes about them, if any.

### Fitness
I track my physical progress there. As I try to be more conscious about my physical health and always trying to become a stronger version of myself every day. I post my progress pictures and my own commentary and thoughts there.

### Family
I have a dedicated journal where I put all the memories I shared with my family.

### Twitter
I use [IFTTT](../../tools/ifttt.md) to [automatically post all my tweets](https://ifttt.com/applets/56660889d-save-your-tweets-to-day-one) from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) here. Since I do want to lead a more open life, I very often post in the public outlets and share my experiences there so I want to have those experiences in Day One together with my more private memories.

### Instagram
Similar to Twitter, [this IFTTT recipe](https://ifttt.com/applets/61918118d-save-your-instagram-photos-to-day-one) will do the same but for my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/nikitavoloboev/) photographs.

## Looking back
Besides Day One, I lead a more open diary and monthly overviews in [Looking back](../../looking-back/looking-back.md).
