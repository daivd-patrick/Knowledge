I currently use hazel to instantly commit any changes I make to CSV files of [web searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) and [ask-create-share](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-ask-create-share) workflows.

## Notes
- If you want to have your rules to be applied onto subfolders as well as the directory chosen, add this rule

- If extensions are hidden, don't add extensions in the rule editor too
