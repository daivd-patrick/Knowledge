# [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/)
The app I use to keep up with my RSS feeds. I use RSS to follow my favourite blogs, stay up to date on new podcast episodes and even track some software releases.

I use [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) to sync my feeds between phone and mac. [Here](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/f67d6d37a8c32fa6f86a23bd77107fbd) is my XML subscription feed of blogs I follow.

Here is how Reeder looks like for me:
