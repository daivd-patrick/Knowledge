The app I use to keep up with my RSS feeds. I use RSS to follow my favourite blogs, stay up to date on new podcast episodes and even track some software releases.

I use [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com) to sync my feeds between phone and mac. [Here](../../research/blogs.md) is a list of blogs I follow and like.

Here is how Reeder looks like for me:
