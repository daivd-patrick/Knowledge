# [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.

It has a [wonderful community](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/) that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve.

I share [all the macros I use](km-macros.md) with the app.

## Notes
- It is always better to run compiled AppleScripts.
- [Assert action](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/assert-action/8374). "If not condition, then fail". Useful for checking if you got right kind of data.
