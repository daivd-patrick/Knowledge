# Awgo

A [really awesome library](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) made by [Deanishe](https://github.com/deanishe).

Will try to document things I know on how to effectively use it or at least how I use it here. It is really powerful and when combined with the speed and awesomeness of Go, things can't get better.
