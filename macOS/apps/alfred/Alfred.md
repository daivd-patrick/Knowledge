# [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
Alfred is a macOS launcher that is extremely powerful as you can program it to show what you want. [Here](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows) are all the workflows I really love to use with it.

## Clean prompt
Sometimes when passing things from one object into another, you want to clear your {query} being passed to get a clean prompt. To achieve this you can set argument utility and set it as empty like here:

## Exclude certain folders or files from being searched
For example, if you have a file filter that searches through some folders and its contents but you don't wish for it to search some big `node_modules` folder. You can simply add this folder to Spotlight preferences under _privacy_ tab like here :

## Symlink workflows
It is a great idea to symlink workflows you are working on so you can work on them in the comfort of your file system and not inside Alfred UUID named directories.

You can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/deanishe/35faae3e7f89f629a94e) to achieve this. In example of [this workflow](https://github.com/fractaledmind/alfred_zotquery) you can use it as follows `workflow-install.py -s source` since source dir contains the `info.plist` of the workflow. I can also then use [this script](https://gist.github.com/deanishe/b16f018119ef3fe951af) and build my workflow with `workflow-build.py -v source`.

## Notes
- [Package workflows from CLI with version numbers](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/10838-how-to-package-workflows-from-the-command-line/?tab=comments#comment-55677)
- Alfred can preserve a user's Hotkey shortcuts, keywords and workflow variable values. Everything else in the workflow directory gets overwritten.
