# Alfred

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a macOS launcher that is extremely powerful as you can program it to show what you want. [Here](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows) are all the workflows I really love to use with it.

For example, if you have a file filter that searches through some folders and its contents but you don't wish for it to search some big `node_modules` folder. You can simply add this folder to Spotlight preferences under _privacy_ tab like here :
