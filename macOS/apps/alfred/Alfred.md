# Notes

- you can't exclude paths in Alfred file filters but you can exclude certain other things to get around this 
	- i.e. I wanted to search for folders in my [knowledge repo](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) but not search node\_modules
	- I added a finder comment to node\_modules like so

- and then in my Alfred File filter I said to skip files where the comment is _skip_
