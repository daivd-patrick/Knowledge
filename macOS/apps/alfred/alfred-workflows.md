# Alfred workflows
I use many many workflows throughout my day. And I include all the workflows I like and use [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows).

My most used workflows at current time would probably be [Searchio](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-searchio), [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind), [Web Searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) and [Safari Assistant](https://git.deanishe.net/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant). 

Coupled with many many other finely tuned File Filters I made and other workflows I use in various other contexts. I hope to add more workflows of my own to the mix with time.
