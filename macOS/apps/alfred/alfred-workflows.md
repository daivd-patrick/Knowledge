# Alfred workflows
I use many many workflows throughout my day. And I include all the workflows I like and use [here](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows#amazing-alfred-workflows-).

My most used workflows at current time would probably be [Searchio](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-searchio), [My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind), [Web Searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches), [Safari Assistant](https://github.com/deanishe/alfred-safari-assistant), [Ask, Create Share](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-ask-create-share) and [Learn Anything](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-learn-anything).

Coupled with [many other finely tuned File Filters I made and other workflows I use in various other contexts](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows). I hope to add more workflows of my own to the mix with time.
