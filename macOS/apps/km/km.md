# [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. 

You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.

I share all the macros I have made [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/km-macros). Since I am sharing a lot of my macros in that repository, I have [a macro](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/km-macros/master/macros/apps/km/upload%20to%20github%20gist%20-%20[hover%20over%20snippet].kmmacros) to quickly mark macros I published in that repository which simply adds a small tick to the macro icon like here :

## Using the Editor
I use prefixes and hotkeys to quickly navigate all the macros I made in this app. 

Here is a screenshot of how my groups look :

You can see on the top the group is prefixed with `a:`. I prefix groups that have global scope to `a:`. This let's me quickly jump to them.

To quickly jump to the macro group I want, I use [focus on groups macro](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/km-macros/master/macros/apps/km/focus%20on%20groups.kmmacros).

It brings focus to the group sidebar and then you can start typing the starting name of the group you want to jump to. Alternatively, you can use [this](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/macro-go-to-group-by-name-spotlight/4668) which gives you a spotlight like prompt and lets you search for the group you want to jump into.

There is a lot of other things you can do to automate and customise the Keyboard Maestro editor itelf. For more information, you can take a look [here](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/automating-the-keyboard-maestro-editor/4184).
