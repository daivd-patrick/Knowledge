# [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)
Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. 

You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.

I share all the macros I have made in repo [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/km-macros). Since I am sharing a lot of my macros in that repository, I have [a macro](https://cdn.rawgit.com/nikitavoloboev/km-macros/master/macros/apps/km/upload%20to%20github%20gist%20-%20%5Bhover%20over%20snippet%5D.kmmacros) to quickly mark macros I published in that repository which simply adds a small tick to the macro icon like here :
