I use the app to manage events in my life. I sync all events with Google Calendar and I sync many of [my Trello boards](../../sharing/my-trello.md) deadlines with iCal.

I use Fantastical's natural language input together with [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to make new events in seconds.

I always view my events from `Week` view. And show 5 days only with all 24h shown for all days. This lets me have a perspective over what I have to do know. What deadlines I have to complete soon. And gives my the freedom to adjust my schedule in light of upcoming deadlines and events.

## Notes
- To mass delete events, make empty search query (single space) on events I want to remove and delete them. Can also use stock Calendar app and search for `""` and cmd+shift+arrows events I want to delete.
