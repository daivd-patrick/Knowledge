I use the app to manage events in my life.

I take great use of Fantastical's natural language input and I use [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to ease this process.

I always view my events from `Week` view. And show 5 days only with all 24h shown for all days. This lets me have a perspective over what I have to do know. What deadlines I have to complete soon. And gives my the freedom to adjust my schedule in light of upcoming deadlines and events.
