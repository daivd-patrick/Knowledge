I use the app to [fully automate writing repetitive text](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/write-once-never-write-again-c2fa1f6c4e8).

## My Typinator Sets

Here you can find the different Sets that I use in Typinator to speed up my writing.

2. Words - Single word expansions.
3. Phrases - Some phrases I find myself saying often.
4. Questions - Common questions I found myself asking.
5. Dates - Expanding current date in different formats like DD/MM/YYYY.
