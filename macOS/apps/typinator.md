# [Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/)
I use the app to [fully automate writing repetitive text](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/write-once-never-write-again-c2fa1f6c4e8).

I share all the Typinator sets I made with the app [here](typinator#readme).

I use the same trick as in KM to indicate what information should I have in a snippet before activating with by enclosing the info I need to have in the clipboard with {}.

## Notes
- You can press ⌥ + ⌫ to delete snippet without dialogue box.
