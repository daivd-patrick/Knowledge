# [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/)

I love IRC and this is the best macOS client for it.

I created my own theme for it that I love.

I am using Geeza Pro Regular 18pt font.

I love its awesome channel search feature & use it a lot.

## Install theme

To install the theme, download the Monokai Night folder attached from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/mxh1ybdr9x7cfza/AAD6Y--qv3j2yddTY6UJLPyva?dl=1).

Then go to Textual app. Go to preferences and in Styles click on `Browse Styles` here:

Put the downloaded folder inside the folder. You can read [this](https://help.codeux.com/textual/Styles.kb) for more information.

## Notes

- I can inspect HTML of the window by going to `HELP -> Advanced -> Enter Developer Mode` and then right clicking on what I want to inspect.
- Right click on chat background and `Force Reload Style` will reapply the styles you made in the active theme (as well as the JS code).
- CMD + enter when typing will render text as `/me` command. OPT + CMD will allow to write multi line text.
- Can jump instantly to a channel using url scheme. With `Developer Mode` enabled, right click on channel and `Copy Unique Identifier`. Then open URL (in KM) like `textual://goto/2F49204B-971F-4016-920B-CC15A308581C` where the thing after `goto/` is the id.
- ⌥⌘U = hide right sidebar.
