# [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/)

I use my own Ayu theme for it that you can download from [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/textual). It looks like this:

## Notes
- I can inspect HTML of the window by going to `HELP -> Advanced -> Enter Developer Mode` and then right clicking on what I want to inspect.
