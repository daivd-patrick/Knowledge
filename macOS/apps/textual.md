# [Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual/)
I love IRC and this is the best macOS client for it.

I created my own [Night Blue theme](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/textual) for it that I love.

## Notes
- I can inspect HTML of the window by going to `HELP -> Advanced -> Enter Developer Mode` and then right clicking on what I want to inspect.
