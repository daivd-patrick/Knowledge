# [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/)
I use the app to manage my own personal library of snippets.

I prefix all snippets I make like `vim:` for vim related snippets or `git:` for git related snippets and then I have the [awesome Alfred workflow](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/press-release/whats-new/osx-1.6.html "recent addition") that the author provides to search for this snippets insanely fast :

I tag snippets that I have shared in this wiki with `wiki` tag like so :

This makes me quickly see what I have shared already and what I have not.
