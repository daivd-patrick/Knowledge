I use this app for mapping various trackpad gestures to hotkeys and actions as well as quick one to one hotkey mappings for various apps.

I wrote about how I use the app to heavily customise my gestures in detail in an article [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze). 

I mostly use the app to set one way keybindings. That is single key -> key app specific bindings like this one :

And to set up app specific and global gestures. Like this one :

You can view a printed version of all the bindings I have made [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/blob/master/btt/btt-gestures.pdf) and you can download the preset I use to try some of the bindings I have made for yourself by importng [my preset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/master/btt/main.json) to BetterTouchTool.

Here are some images of the gestures I use.
