# [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)
I use this app for mapping various trackpad gestures to hotkeys and actions as well as quick one to one hotkey mappings for various apps. 

I share all the gestures and mappings I have made with the app in a repo [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-btt) alongside my preferences file in case you wish to use my setup.

I also wrote about how I use the app to heavily customise my gestures in detail in an article [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze).
