# Sticky Keys
### [sticky key example](https://gist.github.com/b591b290c6a55ac47b19158c721415a4)
Snippet above makes `p` key into a modifier key. This only works for old Karabiner on El Captain. I am still not certain how it will look like in Sierra.

# Notes
- You can probably use [this](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements/issues/926) to achieve this behaviour on Sierra but I have not tested it.
