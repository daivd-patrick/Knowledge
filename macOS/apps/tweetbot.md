# [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)
I use the app to stay up to date and communicate on Twitter.

Tweetbot is also blocked for me during my `Focus` time. I can only post tweets but I can't visit the app to see my feeds.

- Twitter is my primary way to stay up to date on things and is my favourite social network after GitHub. I curate and publically share all [Twitter lists](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists) I personally use.

The app is always full screen for me. And is split into four columns.
- First column: Mentions /Messages / Some other list.
- Second column: [Top tweets](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/top1) list. Contains tweets with highest value to me.
- Third column: [ML list](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/ml).
- Fourth column: [Other](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/other1) list. Contains tweets with least priority to me.

Here is how that all looks together for me:
