I use the app to stay up to date and communicate on Twitter.

The app is always full screen for me. And is split into four columns.
- First column: Mentions/Messages/Some other list.
- Second column: [Top tweets](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/top1) list. Contains tweets with highest value to me.
- Third column: [ML list](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/ml "ML").
- Fourth column: [Other](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/other1 "Other") list. Contains tweets with least priority to me.

Here is how that all looks together for me:
