# [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)

I use the app to stay up to date and communicate on Twitter.

I split the app into 2 columns on mac.

- First column: Mentions / Messages / Other
- Second column: [Timeline](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/following). Tweets with highest value to me.

## Notes

- There is a limit of 1600 tweets that can be shown in Timeline or list. More than that will not be shown and tweets will be lost from the feed. ðŸ˜ž
