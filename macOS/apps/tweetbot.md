# [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)

I use the app to stay up to date and communicate on Twitter.

Tweetbot is also blocked for me during my `Focus` time. I can only post tweets but I can't visit the app to see my feeds.

Twitter is my primary way to stay up to date on things and is my favorite social network after GitHub. I curate and publicly share all [Twitter lists](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists) I personally use.

I split the app into 2 columns on mac.

- First column: Mentions / Messages / [Other](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1131319788012285952)
- Second column: [Timeline](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/following). Tweets with highest value to me.

## Notes

- There is a limit of 1600 tweets that can be shown in Timeline or list. More than that will not be shown and tweets will be lost from the feed. ðŸ˜ž
