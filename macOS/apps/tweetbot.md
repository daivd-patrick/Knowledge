# [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)

I use the app to stay up to date and communicate on Twitter.

Tweetbot is also blocked for me during my `Focus` time. I can only post tweets but I can't visit the app to see my feeds.

Twitter is my primary way to stay up to date on things and is my favorite social network after GitHub. I curate and publicly share all [Twitter lists](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists) I personally use.

The app is always full screen for me. And is split into four columns.

- First column: Mentions / Messages / [Software](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/software)
- Second column: [Top](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/top). Tweets with highest value to me.
- Third column: [ML](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/ml). Machine learning news.
- Fourth column: [Other](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/other1) list. Tweets with least priority to me.

Here is how that all looks together for me:
