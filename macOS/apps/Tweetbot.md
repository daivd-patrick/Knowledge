# [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)
I use the app to stay up to date and communicate on Twitter.

The app is always full screen for me with four columns. 
- first : mentions / messages
- second : my [Top tweets](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/top1 "Top") custom list (contains tweets with highest value to me)
- third : [ML list](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/ml "ML")
- fourth : contains my [Other](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/other1 "Other") list (that contains a list of tweets with less priority)

Here is how that all looks together for me:
