# [Tweetbot](https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/)
I use the app to stay up to date and communicate on Twitter.

The app is always full screen for me with four columns. 
- first : mentions / messages
- second : my _top_ custom list (contains tweets with highest value to me)
- third : profile jumps (I use it to quickly jump between user profiles in this column) (I have a macro to quickly do this)
- fourth : contains my _other_ list (that contains a list of tweets with less priority)

Here is how that all looks together for me :
