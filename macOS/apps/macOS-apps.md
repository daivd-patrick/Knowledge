# macOS apps
I maintain a big list of apps I use on my system [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) where each app is ranked from my favourite and most used to less favourite. 

Of course ranking apps like that is a bit hard as each is often a tool that accomplishes some task really well.

Since I use many apps and I customise each one of them heavily to fit my own workflow, I document all of these modifications as a map [here](https://my.mindnode.com/R3rsy7p4juS3HxxwQvrCE6oiMbY6aefKshMX2Qwh). It's quite large.
