# macOS apps
I maintain a big list of apps I use on my system [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) where each app is ranked from my favourite and most used to less favourite.

Of course ranking apps like that is a bit hard as each is often a tool that accomplishes some task really well. I still find the list quite accurate with respect to my own workflow.
