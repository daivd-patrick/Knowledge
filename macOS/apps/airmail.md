# [Airmail](http://airmailapp.com)
By far the most well designed and feature rich mail application that I have used so far, all of its simple design, support for multiple accounts and a multitude of nice shortcuts that you can use.

I approach all of my email tasks in GTD style. Keeping my email Inbox close to 0 at all times.

Airmail provides good set of _onscreen_ keys that you can use to do various actions on mails.

I also automatically sort [newsletters](https://github.com/learn-anything/newsletters#readme) into mailboxes so they never show up in my Inbox and I have to visit my `News` mailbox whenever I want to read these emails. This is a rule set of how you can set it up for yourself:

And here is my sidebar of labels I use for my email accounts:
