I use the app to manage events in my life.

I take great use of Fantastical's natural language input and I use [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to ease this process.

I also use prefixes to indicate that an event is a deadline. For example I may have an event like this :

Which means I have to complete `md parser` by end of Saturday. I can then easily make searches for `d:Â ` in the search bar and see all my deadlines in descending order.
