# [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com)
I currently use Hazel to instantly commit any changes I make to CSV files of [web searches](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-web-searches) and [ask-create-share](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-ask-create-share) as well as all of [LA's curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#curated-lists).

## Notes
- If you want to have your rules to be applied onto subfolders as well as the directory chosen, add this rule.

- If extensions are hidden, don't add extensions in the rule editor too.
