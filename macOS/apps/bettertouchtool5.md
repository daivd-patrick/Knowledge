# [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)
I use this app for mapping various trackpad gestures to hotkeys and actions both globally and per specific application.

Here are my stats from using the app:

I wrote about how I use the app to heavily customise my gestures in detail in an article [here](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze).

You can view a printed version of all the bindings I have made [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/blob/master/btt/gestures.pdf) and you can download the preset I use to try some of the bindings I have made for yourself by importng [my preset](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/btt) to BetterTouchTool.
