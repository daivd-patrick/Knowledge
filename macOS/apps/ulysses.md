# [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/)
The app I use to write all my [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) articles in. As well as writing notes for different [books I read](../../books/books.md).

All your writing in one place is the motto and the underlying design of the app. I hook up my [wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) as an external folder and I love how it creates an index of everything that I can search over:

It also has pretty awesome export functions that let you export the text you write to PDF, ePub and HTML. I mostly use it's ability to export text to Medium.

I use [Ayu](https://styles.ulyssesapp.com/bundle/Ayu/5ae3545d5075368b0270daa9) theme when I write. Here is how it looks:

I describe my thoughts and approach to writing [here](../../writing/writing.md).

## Content structure
I group my writing into appropriate categories. Here are how my categories look like.

I use two [Alfred file filters](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/search-files) to search through both Ulysses sheets and Ulysses groups.

## Writing an article
I start writing all my artciles by jotting down notes as dashed points below the title. Here is how that looks:

I then start writing the article and try to touch on one or all of these points as I write the article. I add/remove points as I write the article.

## Publishing the article
Once I wrote the article that I am quite happy with. I export the article straight to Medium with _Ulysses Medium export_ function. I then reread the article again in Medium's editor and fix any styling issues/mistakes that happened. After that I publish the article and share it on Twitter and other internet places.
