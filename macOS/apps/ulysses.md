# [Ulysses](https://ulyssesapp.com/)
The app I use to write all my [Medium](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) articles in and make [notes for books](../../books/books.md).

I describe my thoughts and approach to writing [here](../../writing/writing.md).

## Content structure
I group my writing into appropriate categories. Here are how my categories look like. I blurred some that are personal to me.

I use two [Alfred file filters](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/search-files) to search through both Ulysses sheets and Ulysses groups.

The reason I have two `Inbox` there is because Alfred's file filter for searching groups doesn't pick up original `Inbox` group.

## Tagging sheets
I tag Ulysses sheets I have published to Medium with `#published` tag like this:

Which allows me to quickly search and filter through Ulysses sheets quickly from Alfred:

Here is how a sheet with an idea looks like:

The dashed points right below the title state some ideas and thoughts I want to cover when writing the article. I try to touch on one or all of these points as I write the article.
