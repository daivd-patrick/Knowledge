# [Contacts](https://support.apple.com/guide/contacts/welcome/mac)
I use Contacts app as a contact book of people I both know and people I am interested in.

I use many prefixes to scope my contacts into groups. Here are all the groups and their prefixes I use.

I then use [this workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/search-for-content#readme) to quickly search through all my contacts and the notes I added to them with Alfred.
