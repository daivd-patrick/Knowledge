# Safari

My favourite and most used app on macOS.

As it is my most used app, I like to script and automate as much of my use of it as possible. 

I open any of my most used websites using [this macro](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/km-macros/blob/master/macros/global/get%20current%20url%20from%20safari.kmmacros). It opens the website I specify or it if the website is not open anywhere in Safari and will jump between the tabs of the website if there is an instance of this website I specify somewhere. I use this macro for pretty much all websites out there and that means I can open any website I wish with a single keypress. Both open and filter through.

Aside from it, I use [many Safari extensions](https://github.com/learn-anything/safari-extensions) for it. Most notable I really love and recommend using [sVim](https://github.com/flipxfx/sVim). My configuration for it can be found below :
