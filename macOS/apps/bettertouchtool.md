# [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net)
I use this app for mapping various trackpad gestures to hotkeys and actions both globally and per specific applications.

Here are my stats from using the app:

I wrote about how I use the app to heavily customize my gestures in detail in an article [here](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze).

You can view a printed version of all the bindings I made [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/blob/master/btt/gestures.pdf) and you can download the preset I use to try some of the bindings I made for myself by importing [my preset](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/tree/master/btt) to BetterTouchTool.

I also use BTT to modify my TouchBar. Here is how it looks:

It includes, from left to right:
1. My [current active TODO](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/tree/master/todo-task#readme)
2. Battery percentage
3. Time until my break from a [Focus session](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/focusing/focusing.html)
4. Current time and day
