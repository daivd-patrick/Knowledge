# [iTerm](https://www.iterm2.com/)

Use Zsh as my shell together with [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) plugin manager and [Pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) theme.

Assigned w + j with [Karabiner](karabiner/karabiner.md) to open the app from Keyboard Maestro in seconds.

I use [Primer GitHub theme](https://github.com/fcaldera/github-primer-iterm2) for it. And share [my iTerm preferences](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wx9ijtq4me8fttp/com.googlecode.iterm2.plist?dl=1).

## My workflow

I always have at least 3 tabs (sessions) always open in iTerm. I open other tabs as the need arise. I use VS Code's integrated terminal for when I need the shell on per project basis.

My always open tabs are:

1. `Jump` - Main tab I use to quickly jump around my file system. Bound to `f+j`.
2. `Run/Workspace` - I use it as extra tab where I sometimes run a server or something where it makes sense. Bound to `f+s`.
3. `Karabiner` - Contains my [Karabiner configuration](karabiner/karabiner.md) I edit in neovim. Bound to `f+.`.

There is a [workflow](https://github.com/isometry/alfred-tty) to quickly switch between active tty sessions. Although I don't use it due to direct keybinds above.
