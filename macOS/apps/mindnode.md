It is an incredible joy to make mind maps in this app and I use it to visualize everything. [My notes, my projects, my plans, my thoughts](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev/mind-map-everything-d27670f70739#.p7w44kr44).

In short, MindNode for me is the ultimate playground where ideas get born and played with first. I even have a __thinking__ map that I open with Karabiner by pressing `f + :`. And I [brainstorm things](../../research/solving-problems.md) I am doing __now__ there. Here is how that looks:

I use mind maps for many things. Since these maps are interactive and allow you to neatly link information together, they are much better suited for some formats. Like visualising different topics and their relations.
