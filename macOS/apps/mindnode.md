An application which allowed me to originally create [all of the maps](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/df7lxpsizx0ukd7/AAAUZzX55vnfZMqTRuhzJbWwa?dl=0) for [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).

I also use MindNode to [visually break down problems I am trying to solve](../../research/solving-problems.md).
