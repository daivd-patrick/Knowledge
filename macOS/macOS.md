# macOS

macOS is my current favourite desktop operating system. Although I've only used two thus far as I have used Windows previously. 

I do wish however to expand my horizons and try out Linux. I doubt I will ever be able to move to another operating system as I have too much invested in optimising and using macOS but I do want to take the best of all worlds. Linux is open source, has an increasingly large community of users and developers and one thing that I love about UNIX systems is that by using these systems you effectively become a developer. Because otherwise you are simply missing out on the _full experience_.

In any way, I like to think my journey with macOS, operating systems, programming and the like has only begun, I am still yet to make something substantial, something akin to [Karabiner][1]. But I am getting there.
