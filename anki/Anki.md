# Anki

Anki is an awesome app that uses [spaced repetition learning](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spaced_repetition) to memorise and learn things efficiently.

I am still yet to start using it well to fit in my workflow but I will be sharing the cards I have made with the app [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/anki-decks).
