# Anki

Anki is an awesome app that uses [spaced repetition learning](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Spaced_repetition) to memorise and learn things efficiently.

I am still yet to start using it well to fit in my workflow but I will be sharing the cards I have made with the app [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/anki-decks).

# Tips

- Review all cards every day, not just one topic. Ensure that you're not hitting the "Review limit" on a deck
- Use tags: Tag all cards that are more likely to appear on your exam and review them more often.
- Use Lapses: if you fail a card n times, then let it be suspended and work on rewording it.
- Reduce the amount of time spend on cards. If you do not have near-instant recall, mark it as "Again" and spend more time learning.

# Notes

- [Anki works due to the exponential decay of memory](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/comments/75bzzc/anki_overwhelms_me/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=Anki)
	- The better you know a card, the less often that it'll be shown to you.
