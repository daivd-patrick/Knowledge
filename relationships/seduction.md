# Seduction

One of the most valuable books I read on the topic of dating and relationships is [Models](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12633800-models). It states that the most important thing in any kind of relationship is honesty. In regards to seduction it is being honest with your intentions. The other important thing is being independent and focusing on developing yourself above else. It's often the case that if the person feels required to be in a relationship, he/she will be at a disadvantage and will show weakness. Your feelings and self worth should never be defined by anyone but you. It is hard/impossible to be your true self if you are trying to impress anyone for fear of losing them. If the relationship or first encounter doesn't work out, don't dwell on it and move on.

Being honest with your intentions together with awareness that the worst cases that can happen will often have no affect on your life at the end of the day brings confidence. The hardest part in doing anything in life including approaching new people to spark a conversation with is the fear of being rejected or some feeling of failure. The worst case that can happen when trying to meet someone is that they will be busy or may simply not want to talk to you and all you will get is valuable experience. Rejection and failure is natural and how humans grow. No one truly cares about your rejection except yourself and that feeling of dwelling on the past is simply a waste of time. Take your learnings and move on. Be yourself and take the chances presented to you.

For first dates or encounters, I find it nice to get to know each other by asking few questions and getting to know them a little and then arranging to meet for a more prolonged time if all feels well. You will know a lot more about each other by talking in real life together over coffee or walk than anything else. For services like Tinder where you get to chat when both of you 'swiped on each other', it can be as simple as saying `I really like you. Want to meet for coffee? üòä` after some time.

Dating apps like Tinder/Bumble are often a [waste of time](https://twitter.com/devonzuegel/status/1087575749949673472). It's often best to approach people you find interesting in real life and asking questions be it for romantic or non romantic reasons. Don't be creepy and make sure the other person feels at ease and wants to talk with you. Try and diversify your life and get into more social hobbies where you get to meet new people often.

## Notes

- It is better to exchange Instagram accounts with girls you've approached than trying to share phone numbers.
- The best dates you can go to are ones where you can easily share a conversation together.
- [‚ÄúNice‚Äù is subjective. Typically, the guys who consider themselves the ‚Äúnice guy‚Äù are the ones who do what they think is nice with an added contingency, as if buying a meal or being a normal human being means they deserve affection and adoration from a girl. Nice guys don‚Äôt finish last, disingenuous guys do. The douche bags get girls because they do what they want, not what they think the girl wants. Moral of the story: be genuine and be your own human being, not what you think people want or expect you to be.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99uixo/nice_guys_finish_last/)
- [Enjoy yourself while talking, don‚Äôt make it your goal to please her, but to enjoy yourself.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99yal5/guys_any_tips_on_how_to_flirt_with_a_girl/)
- [Some women will spend hours getting ready before they go out. If you compliment their style and how they've put themselves together it validates all of that work and goes a lot further than just saying some variation of "you're beautiful".](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/99yal5/guys_any_tips_on_how_to_flirt_with_a_girl/)
- [Consuming information but NOT approaching women?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqDFncK-hJE)
- [It‚Äôs hard because you have to get comfortable with being vulnerable. You have to be open to the chance of getting hurt. Be okay with putting your all out there and getting nothing in return. You have to love who you really are enough to know that regardless of whether the person you‚Äôre trying to open up to accepts you or not, you‚Äôre still the same complete you either way.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/9wv6v5/how_modern_dating_feels/e9nlnmt/)
- [Strong eye-contact, slow movements and masculine body language.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
  - What this guy means by masculine body language is essentially leading and taking control physically. Touch her arms, hold her hands and lightly rub them with your thumbs, twiddle around with her fingers. This works incredibly well if you‚Äôre sitting across a table from her. If you‚Äôre beside her like at a bar, keep her in your frame. Turn your legs toward her so that if she were to move forward she‚Äôd be between them. Again touching her arms, don‚Äôt be aggressive! Move closer to her, whisper in her ear. Hold her close, have your arm around her. Those have worked really well in my experience. That‚Äôs just a few of many possible ways to show her ‚Äúhey, I like you more than someone who just wants to be your friend.‚Äù
- Once your body starts to act masculine, your mind will soon soon follow.
- [Masculine body language - Take up space, don't slouch, don't sit like a chick with your knees together. Don't twitch, be non-reactive. Imagine a lion: he doesn't give a shit about what's going on around him. He's always relaxed with his head up.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
- [The difference between creepy or not, is how attractive you are (which is determined by everything else you're doing).](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/9zgplp/how_to_give_off_a_sexual_vibe/)
  - Just be unflinching during conversation. General rule of thumb for any interaction is to look at their eyes long enough to realise their eye colour (bit longer if your flirting), look away, then back again rinse and repeat. Another tactic for flirting, is using the triangle: left eye, right eye, lips, repeat. Looking at their lips implies you want to kiss them. Use that when you have more rapport.
  - One exercise you can use: If you spot a girl you like, look at her. If she looks your way, make brief eye contact, look away for a moment, then back again. If she's still looking at you, its a good chance she wants you to talk to her. Girls are pretty persistent in getting attention from guys they like.
  - If she's not looking, its a good chance she's not interested. Don't stare at her. Move on.
- Eye-contact is fundamental. When you look a woman in the eye, don't hide the fact that you want her. Maintain eye-contact. This is a very clear signal you are interested in a woman sexually.
  - Just for clarity. When you make eye contact you need to choose an eye. You can't oscillate back and forth between them. And when he says "maintain eye contact" it doesn't mean blankly stare into her eyes uninterrupted. It means when you do look at her, look into her eyes. Not just at her face. And hold that eye contact slightly longer than you would regularly with other people.
- [I think advanced game is loving yourself no matter what happens to you. Rejections, shit tests, break-ups, critics, emotions. These are all opportunities to learn, to improve, to love yourself more, to be authentic, to go forward. It's not about protecting yourself so you don't feel anything anymore, it's about being at peace with what goes inside of you and outside of you. It's about breaking down your limiting beliefs and your expectations, going with the flow and being in the moment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/elut4g/advanced_game_is_just_not_giving_a_fuck/)
- [Stop chasing girls and focus entirely on self development](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/n057n9/female_perspective_on_online_dating/)
- [In person approaching > online dating.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/n057n9/female_perspective_on_online_dating/)
- [Women will respect your courage. It‚Äôs never creepy if you stay respectful. You can‚Äôt get in trouble for talking to strangers. She can‚Äôt do nothing about if your not harassing her. Some guys think talking to women they don‚Äôt know is like against the law.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/myz64b/women_will_respect_your_courage/)
- [The only way to know if she finds you attractive is to approach her.](https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/myz64b/women_will_respect_your_courage/)
- [I really like "I really want to kiss you right now." If they are into it too, they can explicitly give permission ("well then you should!" or something along those lines, or they could just initiate the kiss), and if they're not feeling the same they can just laugh or something to change the subject. It changes the dynamic from "tell me yes or no" to "tell me yes or I'll assume no" and I think there's a real benefit to that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/n36pky/how_do_i_25m_flirt_without_making_a_woman_feel/)
- [Every woman is different so I am sure you will get other answers too but for me personally I don‚Äôt like compliments about my looks too early on - ‚Äúyou look great, I love your dress/shoes/etc‚Äù is ok but the ‚Äúyou are so beautiful‚Äù compliments too early on always make me a bit uneasy. Compliments about my personality always go down better. I would also encourage you not to worry about ‚Äúflirting‚Äù too much - I would much rather talk to a guy who was genuinely interested in getting to know me and my interests than a charming guy who is good at flirting, you know? There‚Äôs nothing wrong with talking to a woman the way you would talk to a friend - especially at the beginning - you are just getting to know each other and finding out if you connect on a deeper level. Keep calm and try to remember not too much too quickly and it will all fall into place. Good luck, I hope you meet some great people.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/n36pky/how_do_i_25m_flirt_without_making_a_woman_feel/)
- [Compliment people on things they choose. So clothes/hair/accessories are fine for a quick compliment on appearance. Then talk about other stuff that they also choose: interests, hobbies, opinions.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/n36pky/how_do_i_25m_flirt_without_making_a_woman_feel/)
- Show genuine interest.
- [You don't need permission to think or feel sexually about someone. It's how you treat them that matters. As far as flirting with people, you will make mistakes and you will make people uncomfortable from time to time, we all do. Just like with other kinds of interaction. If it happens, just apologize and carry on.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/n36pky/how_do_i_25m_flirt_without_making_a_woman_feel/)
- [How would you talk to a potential friend? Speak to this person the same way. Conversation flows or it doesn‚Äôt. Presenting with a list of questions quickly turns a date into an interview. Be yourself, allow silences if they occur and let your activities or what she says guide the conversation. Also don‚Äôt forget you‚Äôre also picking someone here which lowers the pressure of ‚ÄúI hope they like me.‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n406f4/i_30m_am_going_on_my_first_inperson_date_in_over/)
- [I absolutely stopped giving a good goddamn what people thought of me. Apathy apparently comes across as confidence. Being genuinely not interested in impressing anyone led to them trying to impress me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverthirty/comments/n4jslg/people_who_had_a_much_better_dating_life_after_30/)
