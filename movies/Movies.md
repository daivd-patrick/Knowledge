# Movies

I really love watching interesting movies and I have seen quite a few of them thus far. I have many favourite movies but amongst the top movies I have seen, I would put these movies : 

- [Synecdoche, New York](https://letterboxd.com/film/synecdoche-new-york/)
- [A Serious Man](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-serious-man/)
- [Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb](https://letterboxd.com/film/dr-strangelove-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb/)
- [Her](https://letterboxd.com/film/her/)


I track the movies I have seen on [LetterBoxd](https://letterboxd.com/NikitaVoloboev/) and you can see the movies I plan on watching soon [here](./watching-movies.md). I also occasionally [review some of the movies](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/reviews/by/added/) I have seen.

I also made some lists of movies I really liked.
