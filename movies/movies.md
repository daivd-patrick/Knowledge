# Movies
I really love watching interesting movies and I have seen [quite a few of them](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/) thus far.

I love [making lists](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/) of movies I've seen and liked. Like a [list of my favourite movies](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/list/favourite-movies/).

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/jFaHJFow) and [Watchlist](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/watchlist/) of movies I want to watch.

## Movies seen
I track the movies I have seen on [LetterBoxd](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/) and I often [review some of the movies](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/films/reviews/by/added/) I have seen.

Below are the movies I've seen sorted by years I've seen them in.
