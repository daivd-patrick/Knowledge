# Sleep
Sleeping is a way for our brains to flash out all the toxins that accumulated in the brain throughout the day. A kind of human garbage collector.

I don't limit my sleep and I try to sleep as much as my body needs. Usually that is about 7-9 hours.

However I do try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day.
