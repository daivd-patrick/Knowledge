# Books
I love reading new books and making notes on things I've read and learned from the books I read.

I keep a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/MOrnm2aN) of books I am reading and want to read. And I keep a few bookshelves of books I liked on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15768482-nikita-voloboev)

I make notes on all the books I have read. Below are the books I have read or started to read sorted by the year I read (or started reading) the books in.
