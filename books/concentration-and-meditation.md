# Concentration and meditation
- If the mind is concentrated, we do not hear sounds, we do not see anything all our senses are in abeyance. External sounds, external vision, all external sense perceptions, therefore, can be overcome by concentration; and intensity of concentration leads to meditation. 
- Meditation, however, is not an easy thing.
- It means feeling the presence of God within. The highest form of meditation is not thinking of any external object.
