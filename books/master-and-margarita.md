## Review
An Incredible writing style. A book that opened my eyes into the beauty of Russian language. Bulgakov masterfully used the language in his descriptions.

Absolutely loved the book and it did present me with a lot of ideas on what religion is. Eternal life. Love.

There's a lot of sub context regarding the situation of Russia at the time the book was written in. Taking this into account I feel like this is truly a masterpiece in literature.
