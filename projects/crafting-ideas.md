# Crafting ideas

[Crafting Ideas](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas) is my second biggest project of my life thus far that I really wish existed in this world.

Crafting Ideas should help tame my ever increasing list of ideas to do and make. I wish I could have a public profile of ideas that other people can look through and _steal_ or simply send a message and say they too wish this existed in the world. All that matters for me is that an idea manifests into this world somehow, it doesn't have to be made by me. This project should hopefully help in making that wish come true.

Currently I am trying to understand React, Javascript and more of the web stack and build things as I go.
