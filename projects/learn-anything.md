# [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz)
Learn Anything is currently my main project I am working on.

There is a lot of interesting things that still have to be done and since the project is fully [Open Source](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything), all the communication and discussions about this project are done in the open so anyone interested can join in and help.

There is a lot of information included in the [wiki](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/wiki). And there are lots of [curated lists](https://github.com/learn-anything/curated-lists#readme) available that are open to contribution.

Aside from providing links and connected topics to learn from. The end goal is to we create a machine learning system that understand what you know and what you want to learn. And can craft the most optimised path for learning a thing X based on what you know. And that X can be anything. Bash, math, history, macOS..

A kind of Netflix for learning. And as its open source too, anyone who knows code can literally add a feature themselves. If they dont like the direction in which the website is going, they can fork it away.
