# Projects

I have many ideas on projects I want to make and you can see the ones I am working on right now or have completed in the past [here](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/).

Aside from [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz/) which solves many of my own personal problems, I want to create [Crafting Ideas](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/crafting-ideas) which solves another one of my problems of working together on interesting things and finding likeminded people to share ideas and collaborate together.

I will try to give my full attention to both of these projects. It's funny but Crafting Ideas should also help tame my ever increasing list of ideas to do and make. I wish I could have a public profile of ideas that other people can look through and _steal_ or simply send a message and say they too wish this existed in the world. All that matters for me is that an idea manifests into this world somehow, it doesn't have to be made by me. This project should hopefully help in making that wish come true.
