# Knowledge
I don't know many things. And as the saying goes: _"The more you know the more you don't know."_

Still, I would like to know in some ways thing I do __know__. In my opinion of course. Everything can be mastered further and improved upon.

I list things I am learning and want to learn as a [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q). And I list skills I think I am good at on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikitavoloboev/).

## Notes
- Take wherever you’re at and just try to push your understanding deeper.
