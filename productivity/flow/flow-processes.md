# Flow processes
Here are some of my [above described flow processes](./Flow.md) that I try to map for myself. Most I keep privately but others I don't mind sharing. I also make Anki cards of them so I remember both the cue and the action that should be followed.

## Releasing workflows with OneUpdater
- don't forget to update version number and then also commit the workflow so info.plist on GitHub has the latest version

## Research
- have pen and paper always with me

## Making Anki cards
- don't make a card of a fact or something that you can easily look up

## Working
- work to complete the task I have at hand
- turn on [Focus block](https://heyfocus.com) when working and never visit any news sites or discussion forums
- live by my calendar 
	- assign tasks and blocks of time in advance and work through each of the blocks
	- adjust when necessary
