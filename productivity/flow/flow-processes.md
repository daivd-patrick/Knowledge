# Flow processes
Some simple routine tasks I follow to do things.

## Making new Alfred workflow
1. Follow [making workflows outline](../macOS/apps/alfred/making-workflows.md)
	 - don't forget to add update icon when using AwGo

## Starting new projects
1. If I want to experiment with something, make the project in `~/ideas` first and then transfer to the appropriate directories (folders) later
