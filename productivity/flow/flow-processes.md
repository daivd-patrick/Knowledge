# Flow processes
Some simple routine tasks I follow to do things.

## Making new Alfred workflow
1. Follow [making workflows outline](../../macOS/apps/alfred/making-workflows.md). Don't forget to add update icon when using AwGo.

## Starting new projects
1. If I want to experiment with something, make the project in `~/ideas` first and then transfer to the appropriate directories (folders) later.

## Understanding
1. Think it through.
2. Ask myself why this is the way it is.
3. Ask myself what am I missing and what I don't understand (tackle each dependency one by one).
