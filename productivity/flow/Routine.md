# Routine
Repeat things often enough and it becomes a routine. It's useful to be mindful and know what bad habits and routines you possess and break out of them. 

I hope to cultivate and make many healthy routines and habits throughout my life. Here is a start. It simply states thing I should ideally follow or do at any given time throughout the day / week.

## Daily
### Morning
- Brush my teeth
- Moisturise face
- Focus 
- Start working on the first event from my Calendar (often includes cleaning up Today list in 2Do)

### Evening
- Brush my teeth
- Take shower 
- Moisturise face
- Plan the day ahead of me if it is not planned already
- Go to sleep before 11 pm ideally and wake up at the same time ideally

## Weekly

	- see where I spent my time and what I should cut away and focus on and plan accordingly
