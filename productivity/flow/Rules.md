# Rules
Some simple rules to follow for myself doing things.

## Wiki
 - only add snippets of code that are really useful
	- keep simple things I use for my own reference in SnippetsLab only
- Heading should always be on one level heading
	- and Snippets / Notes / Links / on two level heading
	- everything else on three levels where appropriate
- no TODOs in normal wiki entries
	- the wiki is for notes and references and some actionable dedicated lists like [reading](../working-on/Reading.md) or [learning](../working-on/Learning.md).
- describe links on the same line with `:` separator (if needs more description, then sub dash)

## Git
- do atomic commits and write proper appropriate commit messages

## Markdown
- don't leave whitespace between headings and text
- headings should start with capital letter
	- code snippets headings don't have to

## GitHub
- GitHub descriptions should be capitalised 
- add appropriate topics to each repo
- if the readme is long enough, add a table of contents
- don't add anything that is not needed and focus on the content
- add image or logo if possible to visually show the workfow/library in action

## Alfred
- name triggers with spaces between words (all lowercased)
- name all modifier connections

## MindNode
- use lighter themes for sharing (it's nicer) (and using in general)
- use one tree structure for organisation especially when sharing maps (makes the map much easier to follow)

## Writing
- capitalise things properly and use punctuation

## Social Networks
- only add people I really know on Facebook

## Sharing files
- more permanent shares are shared with Dropbox
- temporary shares with [Transfer](https://transfer.sh)
 - if the files are stored on GitHub somewhere, I can use [this](http://rawgit.com/) to get a downloadable link of the raw file

## Releasing workflows with OneUpdater
- don't forget to update version number and then also commit the workflow so info.plist on GitHub has the latest version

## Research
- have pen and paper always with me

## Making Anki cards
- don't make a card of a fact or something that you can easily look up

## Working
- work to complete the task I have at hand
- turn on [Focus block](https://heyfocus.com) when working and never visit any news sites or discussion forums
- live by my calendar 
	- assign tasks and blocks of time in advance and work through each of the blocks
	- adjust when necessary

## SnippetsLab
- include all useful snippets in this wiki and add `wiki` tag
	- if I delete a snippet with `wiki` tag, delete it from wiki too
- create smart group for each new prefix I add

## Planning
- plan the next day in advance in the calendar
	- plan deadlines one week in advance
	- follow through with the plan but adapt where necessary
