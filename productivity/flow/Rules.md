# Rules
Some simple rules to follow for myself doing things.

## General
- Name and prefix things with focus on clarity. The semantics of prefixes should be obvious. And naming should be appropriate.

## Wiki
 - Only add snippets of code that are really useful.
	- Keep simple things I use for my own reference in SnippetsLab only.
- Heading should always be on one level heading.
	- And Snippets / Notes / Links / on two level heading.
	- Everything else on three levels where appropriate.
- Describe links on the same line with `-` separator (if needs more description, then sub dash).
- Don't repeat myself or anyone else.
	- If something has already been said either by me or someone else, link to it (especially in this wiki).
- Interlink entries between each other often within wiki where necessary.
	- Don't over do it.
- Try to use other services for logging and other things where possible. Like in the case of [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/NikitaVoloboev/) and its Lists feature. It's better to make lists there and link to them from wiki.

## Git
- Always initialise new projects with Git.
- Do atomic commits and write proper appropriate commit messages.
- Don't use emojis in commit messages. Aside from âœ¨ commit in [Knowledge](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) repo. 
	- Everything else, add explicit, ideally atomic commit messages.

## Code
- Comment over my code (be mindful of not repeating things, sometimes code speaks for itself).
- Uppercase comments for consistency.
- Write code to be read by other people. Prefer to be explicit over implicit.

## Karabiner
- Document any changes I make in Karabiner map instantly in the map (update where necessary).
- Try to make semantic mappings and chunk mappings by theme or context.

## Markdown
- Don't leave whitespace between headings and text.
- Don't need to add `:` to the end of text when adding image below as it is implicit

## GitHub
- Add appropriate topics to each repo.
- Make many experiments and share them.
- Add credits to repos and acknowledge work of people I am using.

## GitHub README
- Use HTML for rendering images as I have more control on the size and things.
- Add appropriate _quote_ to briefly describe the repo (often is the same as description but with links)
	- Don't repeat what is said in the quote in the description underneath the quote.
- If the readme is long enough, add a `Contents` table
- Don't add anything that is not needed and focus on the content.
- Add image or logo if possible to visually show the workflow / library in action.
- Don't link to Imgur images as links, render them in the GitHub README itself.
- In screenshots of Alfred prompts and other prompts, show the cursor.
- Add `Related` section to most repos linking to similar projects either of my own or of other 
	- Not all projects need this.
- Don't add Thank You clause in `idea` stage projects.
- If the project has many ways to contribute, create a `contributing.md` file and link to it.

## Alfred
- Name triggers with spaces between words (all lowercased)
- Release all my workflows (that have no sensitive information) either in small workflows or standalone if they contain quite a bit of code
- Add keyword triggers and descriptions to workflows even if I don't use them
- Name all modifier triggers (uppercased)

## MindNode
- Use lighter themes for sharing (it's nicer) (and using in general)
- Use one tree structure for organisation especially when sharing maps (makes the map much easier to follow)

## Writing
- Use proper punctuation and capitalise things appropriately
- When adding `:`, don't add space beforehand
- Remove unnecessary words
	- If something can be said in less words, say it in less words
	- Always try to be clear and to the point
- Both in code and prose. Say more with less and never repeat myself.

## Social Networks
- Only add people I really know on Facebook.
- Only add/follow people I am really interested in other networks.

## Sharing files
- More permanent shares are shared with Dropbox
	-  Don't delete items from `shares` folder unless I delete the file somewhere myself
- Temporary shares with [Transfer](https://transfer.sh)
 - If the files are stored on GitHub somewhere, I can use [this](http://rawgit.com/) to get a downloadable link of the raw file

## Releasing workflows with OneUpdater
- Don't forget to update version number and then also commit the workflow so info.plist on GitHub has the latest version

## Working
- Work to complete the task I have at hand
- Turn on [Focus block](https://heyfocus.com) when starting a work block and focus fully on the tasks
	- adjust the focus list to block even more distractions and tune my workflow to only do the task/s I have
- Live by my calendar 
	- assign tasks and blocks of time in advance and work through each of the blocks
	- adjust when necessary
- Work away from home.

## SnippetsLab
- Upload all non sensitive snippets as Gists.
- Create smart group for each new prefix I add.
- Add correct language syntax to every snippet.
- Prefer to use comments in the code itself rather than notes (easier to follow).

## Planning
- Plan the next day fully in advance in the calendar
	- plan deadlines one week in advance
	- follow through with the plan but adapt where necessary

## My Mind
- Uppercase entries in the main map + articles / GitHub + notes

## 2Do
- Only contain things I really need to get done in `Today`
- All 2Do tasks need to be actionable
- Work on tasks based on priority (starred completed first)

## Ideas
- If the idea is not private or something really small
	- Share it in the wiki (or hopefully soon in crafting ideas)

## Capitalising things
- Capitalise everything where appropriate (Sentences / Headings / Alfred workflows / GitHub descriptions / GitHub issues and PRs / Comments in SnippetsLab / Main dashed points / Tweets / ..)

## Ship app
- Prioritise repos in the sidebar

## Stack Overflow CV
- Only add repositories that are meaningful to the list

## Reading books
- Make notes as you read books
- Review each book you read on Goodreads and add it to an appropriate category 
	- add the review to [books](../books/Books.md) after

## Productivity
- Always have water next to me. Drink water when taking breaks and take breaks.
- Set deadlines for all things. Adjust plan according to the deadlines.
- Sound of rain and thunderstorm is the best sound to write code to.
- Limit distractions. Strive to increase signal to noise ratio. 

## Anki
 - Post all my anki decks in the wiki here under [anki decks](../anki/anki-decks.md)
- Lowercase all deck names and folders
- Follow the same capitalising rules as in markdown for making cards
	- start all cards capitalised
- Don't make a card of a fact or something that you can easily look up

## Product Hunt
- Add products I like to an appropriate collection.

## Vim
- Document my main mappings in the vimrc itself (make things easier to search for)

## Spotify
- Add all songs I like to my Likes playlist
	- add all songs I _really_ like to Favourites playlist
	- add songs to other playlists accordingly 

## Focus
- Be very aggressive in cutting any kind of distractions when working 
	- look at where I spend my time in Timing and cut those out with Focus and scripts

## Airmail
- Action on all emails and keep Inbox 0 at all times
- Archive emails if I want them to be searchable later 
	- delete emails otherwise
- Label all emails accordingly (if it is appropriate)

## Licensing
- License my own code under MIT
- License curated lists and other things under [CC1](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) 

## File naming
- Prefer to use `-` instead of `_` in naming script files.

## Prefixing
- Prefer to have the prefix reference the name in some way for easier mental mapping of prefix to meaning.

## Sleep
- Prefer to sleep and wake up at the same time. 
	- 5:30AM- Wake up.
	- 10:00PM - Sleep.
- Sleep for \~ 7 hours each day.

## 1Password
- Write down licenses of things purchased in there

## Tracking

- Mark memorable moments throughout the day and put them in `Photo a Day` journal. 

## Images
- Keep screenshots and interesting images saved in Pixave.k

- Index knowledge that is actionable in case I might need to reference it later.

## Email
- Do emails in burst. Bring my inbox to 0 every day. Action on each email.
- Star emails that are important and I may need to reference late.
