# Rules
Some simple rules to follow for myself doing things.

## General
- Name and prefix things with focus on clarity. The semantics of prefixes should be obvious. And naming should be appropriate.

## Nutrition
- No processed sugar (includes sugary carbonated beverages (drink water!)).
- No food with extra sugar in it.
- No meat or dairy products (health and [ethical reasons](../../life/Compassion.md)).
- No drinks other than water, coffee and tea. No added sugar in the drinks.

## Wiki
 - Only add snippets of code that are really useful.
	- Keep simple things I use for my own reference in SnippetsLab only.
- Heading should always be on one level heading.
	- And Snippets / Notes / Links / on two level heading.
	- Everything else on three levels where appropriate.
- Describe links on the same line with `-` separator (if needs more description, then sub dash).
- Don't repeat myself or anyone else.
	- If something has already been said either by me or someone else, link to it (especially in this wiki).
- Interlink entries between each other often within wiki where necessary.
	- Don't over do it.
- Try to use other services for logging and other things where possible. Like in the case of [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/NikitaVoloboev/) and its Lists feature. It's better to make lists there and link to them from wiki.

## Adding resources (links)
- When adding resources and bookmarks. Priorotise adding them to LA curated lists first and LA itself (not Trello).

## Git
- Always initialise new projects with Git.
- Do atomic commits and write [proper appropriate commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
- Start commits uppercased and prefix them with an action (Add/Remove/Fix/Update). Use imperative tense.
- Don't use emojis in commit messages.

## Dotfiles
- Comment all my aliases briefly saying what they do. Comment all zsh functions. Be mindful that I can then search through these functions and aliases later.

## Code
- Comment over my code (be mindful of not repeating things, sometimes code speaks for itself).
- Uppercase comments for consistency.
- Write code to be read by other people. Prefer to be explicit over implicit.
- Only add one space after the code for inline comments. Don't space them out.
- Delimit files that have spaces with `-` instead of `_`.

## Keyboard Maestro
- All macro names are lowercased. Unless it is necessary like snippet trigger.

## Karabiner
- Document any changes I make in Karabiner map instantly in the map (update where necessary).
- Try to make semantic mappings and chunk mappings by theme or context.
- Prefix variable names by action (i.e. EDIT/OPEN/ALFRED).

## Markdown
- Don't leave whitespace between headings and text.
- Don't need to add `:` to the end of text when adding image below as it is implicit.

## GitHub
- Add appropriate topics to each repo.
- Make many experiments and share them.
- Add credits to repos and acknowledge work of people I am using.
- Use relative links instead of hard wired links. For example in GitHub you can use `../../issues/` to reference issues of current repo from readme.
- Lowercase license, contributing and readme files. There is no need for them to be uppercased.

## GitHub README
- Use HTML for rendering images as I have more control on the size and things.
- Add appropriate _quote_ to briefly describe the repo (often is the same as description but with links).
	- Don't repeat what is said in the quote in the description underneath the quote.
- If the readme is long enough, add a `Contents` table.
- Don't add anything that is not needed and focus on the content.
- Add image or logo if possible to visually show the workflow / library in action.
- Don't link to Imgur images as links, render them in the GitHub README itself.
- In screenshots of Alfred prompts and other prompts, show the cursor.
- Add `Related` section to most repos linking to similar projects either of my own or of other.
	- Not all projects need this.
- Don't add Thank You clause in `idea` stage projects.
- If the project has many ways to contribute, create a `contributing.md` file and link to it.

## Alfred
- Keyword triggers should be one string (no spaces). Try to make keyword be semantically appropriate to workflow and easy to memorise and type.
- Name external triggers with spaces between words (all lowercased).
- Release all my workflows (that have no sensitive information) either in small workflows or standalone if they contain quite a bit of code
- Add keyword triggers and descriptions to workflows even if I don't use them
- Name all modifier triggers (uppercased)

## MindNode
- Use one tree structure for organisation especially when sharing maps (makes the map much easier to follow).

## Writing
- Use proper punctuation and capitalise things appropriately
- When adding `:`, don't add space beforehand
- Remove unnecessary words
	- If something can be said in less words, say it in less words
	- Always try to be clear and to the point
- Both in code and prose. Say more with less and never repeat myself.
- When wanting to reference a certain URL, I don't need to mention `and you can see it here`. I can most likely just change the thing I want to show and wrap that in URL. It looks cleaner this way and saves space.

## Social Networks
- Only add/follow people I am really interested in or know.

## Sharing files
- More permanent shares are shared with Dropbox
	-  Don't delete items from `shares` folder unless I delete the file somewhere myself
- Temporary shares with [Transfer](https://transfer.sh)
 - If the files are stored on GitHub somewhere, I can use [this](http://rawgit.com/) to get a downloadable link of the raw file

## Releasing workflows with OneUpdater
- Don't forget to update version number and then also commit the workflow so info.plist on GitHub has the latest version

## Working
- Work to complete the task I have at hand.
- Always turn [Focus](https://heyfocus.com) when starting to work and make things and fully focus on the task/s at hand.
	- Adjust the focus list to block even more distractions and tune my workflow to only do the task/s I have.
- Live by my calendar.
	- Assign tasks and blocks of time in advance and work through each of the blocks.
	- Adjust when necessary.
- Work away from home ideally.

## SnippetsLab
- Upload all non personal snippets as Gists.
- Create smart group for each new prefix I add.
- Add correct language syntax to every snippet.
- Prefer to use comments in the code itself rather than notes (easier to follow).
- All snippet titles are lowercased. Notes are uppercased.
- Map command line tools in the curated list. Only add commands where I do want to add some optional commands as snippet to SnippetsLab.

## Planning
- Plan the next day fully in advance in the calendar
	- plan deadlines one week in advance
	- follow through with the plan but adapt where necessary

## My Mind
- Uppercase entries in the main map + articles / GitHub + notes

## 2Do
- Only contain things I really need to get done in `Today`
- All 2Do tasks need to be actionable
- Work on tasks based on priority (starred completed first)

## Ideas
- If the idea is not private or something really small
	- Share it in the wiki (or hopefully soon in crafting ideas)

## Capitalising things
- Capitalise everything where appropriate (Sentences / Headings / Alfred workflows / GitHub descriptions / GitHub issues and PRs / Comments in SnippetsLab / Main dashed points / Tweets / ..)

## Ship app

## Anki
 - Post all my anki decks in the wiki here under [anki decks](../anki/anki-decks.md)
