# Rules
Some simple rules to follow for myself doing things.

## Ulysses
- don't leave whitespace between headings and text
- headings should start with capital letter
	- code snippets headings don't have to
- snippets of code headings should be on three level heading

## Alfred
- name triggers with spaces between words (all lowercased)

## Wiki
 - only add snippets of code that are really useful
	- keep simple things I use for my own reference in SnippetsLab only
- Heading should always be on one level heading
	- and Snippets / Notes / Links / on two level heading
	- everything else on three levels where appropriate
- no TODOs in normal wiki entries
	- the wiki is for notes and references and some actionable dedicated lists like [reading](../working-on/Reading.md) or [learning](../working-on/Learning.md).
