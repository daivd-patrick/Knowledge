# Rules
Some simple rules to follow for myself doing things.

## Wiki
 - Only add snippets of code that are really useful
	- keep simple things I use for my own reference in SnippetsLab only
- Heading should always be on one level heading
	- and Snippets / Notes / Links / on two level heading
	- everything else on three levels where appropriate
- Describe links on the same line with `-` separator (if needs more description, then sub dash)
- Don't repeat myself or anyone else
	- if something has already been said either by me or someone else, link to it
- Interlink entries between each other often within wiki where necessary 
	- don't over do it

## Git
- Do atomic commits and write proper appropriate commit messages
- Don't use emojis in commit messages aside from âœ¨ commit

## Code
- Comment over my code (be mindful of not repeating things, sometimes code speaks for itself)

## Karabiner
- Document any changes I make in Karabiner map instantly in the map (update where necessary)

## Markdown
- Don't leave whitespace between headings and text
- Don't need to add `:` to the end of text when adding image below as it is implicit

## GitHub
- Add appropriate topics to each repo
- Make many experiments and share them (add the experiments to the bottom of the mindnode map so they are not seen instantly)

## GitHub README
- Use HTML for rendering images as I have more control on the size and things
- Add appropriate _quote_ to briefly describe the repo (often is the same as description but with links)
- If the readme is long enough, add a table of contents
- Don't add anything that is not needed and focus on the content
- Add image or logo if possible to visually show the workflow / library in action
- Don't link to Imgur images as links, render them in the GitHub README itself
- In screenshots of Alfred prompts and other prompts, show the cursor
- Add `Related` section to most repos linking to similar projects either of my own or of other 
	- not all projects need this

## Alfred
- Name triggers with spaces between words (all lowercased)
- Release all my workflows (that have no sensitive information) either in small workflows  or standalone if they contain quite a bit of code

## MindNode
- Use lighter themes for sharing (it's nicer) (and using in general)
- Use one tree structure for organisation especially when sharing maps (makes the map much easier to follow)

## Writing
- Use proper punctuation and capitalise things appropriately

## Social Networks
- Only add people I really know on Facebook 
- Only add / follow people I am really interested in other networks

## Sharing files
- more permanent shares are shared with Dropbox
	-  don't delete items from `shares` folder unless I delete the file somewhere myself
- temporary shares with [Transfer](https://transfer.sh)
 - if the files are stored on GitHub somewhere, I can use [this](http://rawgit.com/) to get a downloadable link of the raw file

## Releasing workflows with OneUpdater
- Don't forget to update version number and then also commit the workflow so info.plist on GitHub has the latest version

## Working
- Work to complete the task I have at hand
- Turn on [Focus block](https://heyfocus.com) when starting a work block and focus fully on the task
	- adjust the focus list to block even more distractions and tune my workflow to only do the task/s I have
- Live by my calendar 
	- assign tasks and blocks of time in advance and work through each of the blocks
	- adjust when necessary

## SnippetsLab
- Upload all non sensitive snippets as Gists
- Include all useful snippets in this wiki and add `wiki` tag
	- if I delete a snippet with `wiki` tag, delete it from wiki too
	- useful = something substantial that can't easily be Googled
- Create smart group for each new prefix I add
- Add correct language syntax to every snippet
- Don't strip prefixes in snippets when sharing Gists

## Planning
- Plan the next day fully in advance in the calendar
	- plan deadlines one week in advance
	- follow through with the plan but adapt where necessary

## My Mind
- Uppercase entries in the main map + articles / GitHub + notes

## 2Do
- Only contain things I really need to get done in `Today`

## Ideas
- If the idea is not private or something really small
	- share it in the wiki (or hopefully soon in crafting ideas)

## Capitalising things
- Main dashed points
	- sub dash points (like this one) don't have to be capitalised
- Headings
- GitHub descriptions
- All GitHub issues and PRs
- Nodes in my mind
- Alfred workflows
- Normal other sentences
- Comments in Snippets of SnippetsLab

## Ship app
- Prioritise repos in the sidebar

## Stack Overflow CV
- Only add repositories that are meaningful to the list

## Reading books
- Make notes as you read books
- Review each book you read on Goodreads and add it to an appropriate category 
	- add the review to [books](../books/Books.md) after

## Anki
 - Post all my anki decks in the wiki here under [anki decks](../anki/anki-decks.md)
- Lowercase all deck names and folders
- Follow the same capitalising rules as in markdown for making cards
	- start all cards capitalised
- Don't make a card of a fact or something that you can easily look up

## Product Hunt
- Add products I like to an appropriate collection

## Vim
- Document my main mappings in the vimrc itself (make things easier to search for)

## Spotify
- Add all songs I like to my Likes playlist
	- add all songs I _really_ like to Favourites playlist
	- add songs to other playlists accordingly 

## Focus
- Be very aggressive in cutting any kind of distractions when working 
	- look at where I spend my time in Timing and cut those out with Focus and scripts
