# Productivity
My personal productivity is very important to me.

I always try to find things that work best for myself. I also try to track and quantify my own productivity using various tools.

My biggest goal and challenge with productivity is trying to minimise distactions and maximise my working output and [focus](../productivity/focusing.md) when working on things.

## Notes
- You can't manage projects; you can only manage actions related to projects.
