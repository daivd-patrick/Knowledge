# Focusing
Focusing on the things I need to be doing is quite hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

My main goal with focusing is reaching the [state of flow](flow/flow.md) as soon as possible and keeping it for as long as possible throughout the day.

## Focusing on what's important
I keep a private Trello board where I outline things that I want to focus on in life and achieve. I try to not work on long periods of time and predict things in advance for over three month and instead work in very short time frames whilist having some end goal(s) in mind of what I ultimately want to achieve. Here is how my __Focus__ Trello board looks:

## Things that help me
- I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) to block a particular set of websites for 90 minutes (front pages of Hacker News, Reddit, ..).
- And I like to listen to some stimulating music. Lately been enjoying listening to [this](spotify:user:nikitavoloboev:playlist:0epiRzQHjdJieYr0y3TdST).
- Working outside from home and changing location often is also something helps me a lot in being productive.
- I also realised that multiple monitors is not so helpful for me after all and I am quite productive with just a macbook.
- I also try to [live by my calendar](../macOS/apps/fantastical.md). That is I try to assign blocks of time where I work on certain things and actually follow through and work during these time blocks. There is always something useful that I can be doing and I don't want to waste any mental energy choosing what to do in the moment.
