# Focusing
Focusing on the things I need to be doing is quite hard and I am always trying to lure [my monkey brain](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) to actually listen to me and not live a life of its own.

## Things that help me
- I use [this app](https://heyfocus.com) to block a particular set of websites for 1 hour (website like Hacker News, Reddit).
- And I like to listen to some stimulating music. Lately I have been really liking listening [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzv0sfXDEGU).
- Working outside from home and changing location often is also something helps me a lot being productive.
- I also realise that multiple monitors is not so helpful for me after all and I am quite productive with just one.
- I also try to live by my calendar. That is I try to assign blocks of time where I work on certain things and actually follow through and work during these time blocks. There is always something useful that I can be doing and I don't want to waste any mental energy choosing what to do in the moment.
