# My workflow in writing and maintaining this wiki
I write all these entries in [Ulysses](../macOS/apps/Ulysses.md) app and since all of the entries are simply markdown files sorted into folders and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge). I hook this git _knowledge_ folder to Ulysses as external folder :

And then I have all the power of Ulysses search across my entire wiki base + my personal entries :

I also use two specialised Alfred workflows. One that specifically searches through folders in this _knowledge_ main folder :

And then on activation will open these folders in Ulysses so I can quickly add more notes to the folder. I then have another workflow that searches for all the markdown files in this _knowledge_ folder :

And then it opens these markdown files in Ulysses for quickly editing them.

Aside from these two workflows I heavily automate and customise Ulysses to my liking. And I use this Keyboard Maestro macro to quickly start editing my [SUMMARY file](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/blob/master/SUMMARY.md) which defines the order in which Gitbook actually renders my markdowns. Here is how this simple macro looks like :

I also use this macro to quickly create folders in this wiki :

And finally, the most used macro I use to fully automate updating this wiki is simply committing all the changes in this wiki with a single hotkey :

And that is pretty much it. This lets me be extremely fast with editing and maintaining this wiki. I also heavily make use of this wiki by searching through Gitbook book itself :
