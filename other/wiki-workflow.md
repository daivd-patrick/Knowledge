# My workflow in writing and maintaining this wiki
The entire wiki is one folder that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge). It has many folders with subfolders or entries inside.

The order with which GitBook renders the files in the sidebar to your left is defined in [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/blob/master/SUMMARY.md).

I write and edit all the markdown files in this `knowledge` folder from [Sublime Text](../text-editors/sublime-text.md).

I use [this Alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/small-workflows/blob/master/personal/Manage%20wiki.alfredworkflow?raw=true) to quickly search through all the `.md` files that are found in this wiki.

This workflow also searches through all fodlers in this wiki and lets me create new folders inside those folders or create new entries (md files) inside the folders.

## Making notes on books
When reading books, I make notes on the books I have read as I read the book. For that I use [Ulysses](../macOS/apps/ulysses.md) and usually split the book and and Ulysses side by side as I read the book and make notes:

Ulysses is also pretty amazing in that it indexes all the content and lets me make textual searches on this content like so:

## Using this wiki
Now that I can edit this wiki and extend it at the speed of a thought. I can open any of the wiki entries in seconds by searching for the file I need with [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind).

And anyone who owns Alfred can download the workflow and search through too. Outside of that, Gitbook also provides a pretty neat search in the wiki itself. In there you can make textual queries too and files where the queried text is will be shown.
