# Advice
Some advice I received and liked or read in some place.

## Life
- Doing what everybody else is doing feels like the safest thing to do. But it’s also the most competitive, which makes it the riskiest.
- If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.
- Treat people as if they are in a sensitive and malleable emotional state all the time. I have the power to uplift friends and strangers with every interaction, large or small.

## Code
- Run/Right/Fast.
	- Make the code work I write is working. Then I can make it fast (if necessary). Solving the “correct/clean/performant code” problem all at once can be overwhelming. Don’t be overwhelmed. Solve one at a time.
- Reducing the maintenance burden is, for most codebases, the biggest optimization I can do.
	- Of course it's all about striking a balance, but 99% of the time there is a choice between performance and readability, readability is the right answer. Performance should only be chosen if it is absolutely necessary.
- If I write ugly code, anyone who intends to fix a bug or add a feature will not enjoy his work and likely avoid it next time.

## Vim
- Get plugins that meet your needs.
- You're more likely to find useful plugins if you approach it the other way around: I want to do X, vim can't really do it nicely by itself, which plugin can help me do it.
- If something doesn't work in vimrc, put the binding in the bottom of vimrc (perhaps something overrides it).

## Other
- When proposing feature requests, _"for me"_ is never a good argument for a feature request.
	- If I want someone to add a feature to their software, show how it would be useful to lots of users.
- Explicit over implicit is almost always better.
- It can be all too easy to forget your audience has no idea what you’re talking about beyond what you tell them.

## Writing
- Most adverbs are superfluous. Most cases where you say "generally" or "usually" you're undermining your point and the use of "very", "extremely", etc. are hyperbolic and breathless and make it easier to regard what you're writing as unserious.

## Talks
- Giving a talk, it sometimes helps to follow this order:
	1. Why?
	2. How?
	3. What?
- It is sometimes more powerful than the other way around.

## Work
- Figure out what you are uniquely the best in the world at because you just love it. And then just find out who or what needs that the most.

## Learning
- Take wherever you’re at and just try to push your understanding deeper.
