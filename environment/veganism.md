# Veganism
## Notes
- [If everyone in the world went to mostly plant-based (like the Okinawan traditional diet), it would be a MUCH better world. The positive impact would be huge. The impact on your health of having animal products only on special occasions would be minimal. I will tell you though, I've done that and when I've had beef after a long vegan run, it makes me sick to my stomach and I'm certain it's not merely psychological.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8x3tfm/is_100_vegan_the_way_to_go/)

- [Veganism should be the moral baseline. If you can live without animals being directly killed or exploited, why wouldnâ€™t you?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/8x3tfm/is_100_vegan_the_way_to_go/)
- [The vegan diet, and veganism in general, is a plant-based diet, and an avoidance of all commodities made from animal products. Its focus is on cruelty to animals. WFPB is another plant-based diet, but with stricter recommendations, that you eat the healthiest of foods, and avoid processed and animal derived foods. I am vegan because I believe cruelty to the animals should be avoided, and I adhere to WFPB because I want to promote my health. To different motivations that produce similar results with a lot of overlap.](https://www.reddit.com/r/PlantBasedDiet/comments/82lw2d/whats_the_difference_between_a_plantbased_and_a/)
