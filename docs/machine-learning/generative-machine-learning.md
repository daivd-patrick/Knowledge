# Generative Machine Learning

## Notes

- [The net effect of the last 18 mo has been to slightly lubricate human imagination, making it easier for individuals to visualize possible worlds/scenes/moods. It’s only a medium-big deal—unless this is a foretaste of similar acceleration in music, code, and text.](https://twitter.com/Ted_Underwood/status/1566787680872157185)
