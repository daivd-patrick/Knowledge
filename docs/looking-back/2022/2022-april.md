# 2022 April

[Turned 27](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcP1UFDo-Q6/), often forget how old I am, just now it's close to 30. Not that age should influence my decisions except maybe take more risk.

Moved this wiki from GitBook to [Docusaurus](../..tools/docusaurus.md). Made entry to wiki more detailed and pleasant to read. It's cool to see how investing 4+ years into updating one single place for all my knowledge/references starts paying off more and more with time.

Other than above, nothing too exciting happened. Working on Droppa's product. Both excited and sad that this and next months will be the last we'll see of the [Breaking Bad](https://trakt.tv/shows/breaking-bad) / [Better Call Saul](https://trakt.tv/shows/better-call-saul) story.

## Listened

Listened a lot of [oqbqbo](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0sxuAo23kwvWKzFmJpLHmw). Her songs like [Rei](https://open.spotify.com/track/6upreF4yNirvmHslvUSyab) & [With Light Behind](https://open.spotify.com/track/1fHJYUSwft1zVJPd2FfE09) are nice to work with.

## Goals

Aside from moving wiki to Docusaurus, I also released new iteration of my website on [nikiv.dev](https://nikiv.dev). So plan is to make it more usable.
