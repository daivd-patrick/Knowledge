# 2022 July

Staying in my parent's Spanish house this Summer. Going to build some exciting things hopefully. Every time I come back and meet the family, I'm reminded by what I truly care about. My dogs: Rachel and Layci. The cats: Lex, Snoop and Didi. My family. My fiance. It's nice to spend time with them. I also hope to teach my sister and brother coding. I had my first few lessons already and it was great fun. 

## 1: Picking up day evaluations & Obsidian

I once had a habit of writing [day evaluations](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/day-evaluations-5706f31c9c5e) reviewing my day every day, first on a card, then digitally in [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) and now here in my wiki. I was hesitant of trying out [Obsidian](../../tools/obsidian.md) for a while as I was quite happy with my workflow in sublime text. Well kind of happy as it has some rough edges especially with respect to internal links. I'm writing this in Obsidian now and I am thinking of picking up the habit of day evaluations again. So this is that first entry for July 1. ðŸ˜º

Today I found out I spent 70â‚¬ for an empty database because I genuinely thought it would cost max 5â‚¬ to just have an empty DB up with [GCP](../../cloud-computing/gcp/gcp.md). Lessons learned.
