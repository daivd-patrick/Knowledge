# 2022

Happy I survived until this day. Majority of the year I spent with nearly 0 euro on my account. And with health issues I have no money to solve. üòø

My fault though. Should stop being so trash at computers. And be [more focused](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1601959862648582145). I know [Karabiner](../../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md) well. I think I am fast at computers. But not fast/smart/focused enough..

Thankful for the [few donations I get a month](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev). Keeps me going. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Trying to use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat#) to make and learn things faster. And hopefully releasing [LA](../../ideas/learn-anything.md) finally. All the health/finance issues I have is living life on hard mode.

I like the idea of setting [themes for next year](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/136). My theme given the mess that's my life where I can't afford a life critical surgery is a year of health, focused projects and financial stability.

Part of me dislikes complaining about how bad things are but another part thinks it's nice to be truthful. And perhaps if my life does get better next year, I get healthy again, I'll have something to look back on and remember that it can always get worse so appreciate what you have. Assuming things get better next year.

Oh and next year I want to go deep into [mushrooms](../../other/mushrooms.md) growing. I found plenty of books to read. Will study it hard, take many photos. My parents built a nice greenhouse in Spain that I plan to use. Was even thinking of building my own water sprinkler for fun. Write some embedded code, do the whole thing with wiring and tubes.

I also finally came to conclusion on which [stack I want to pursue and go deep in exploring](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1606262383315492864).

It's also wild to think that this year in February a pointless bloody war was started still taking many lives. Not sure how I can help stop this sooner other than maybe earning more money and donating to Ukraine. Hope it ends soon and love wins over hate and stupidity.

Here is to better and healthier 2023. üéá

## Music

> [Volt](https://volt.fm/nikitavoloboev) sadly doesn't do year overviews.

But 2 songs I [truly loved](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0phxrDBmTURKDkRNmbpEgO) this year are [After Hours](https://open.spotify.com/track/1sLwXo8jB7Bs2bYy6PZI2G) & [In My Mind](https://open.spotify.com/track/6HEJavNON4wd0cy1Hp6KV2). But generally so many great songs in my [Likes playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ERn0U4qZIKC8Dy7RrMMsn) that it's nearly certain I'll hit a great song I love. Listening to [Don't Go](https://open.spotify.com/track/0uEkjfrhyIeHnxlrd8LV3t) as I write this.

## Movies/Series

I'm quite happy that I continued writing all my monthly look backs and usually mention things I liked watching/listening in them. But from top of my mind, from series, I liked [Andor](https://trakt.tv/shows/star-wars-andor), [House of Dragon](https://trakt.tv/shows/house-of-the-dragon), [Severance](https://trakt.tv/shows/severance) & finishing [Better Call Saul](https://trakt.tv/shows/better-call-saul).

And from movies, I liked [Batman](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-batman/), [Top Gun: Maverick](https://letterboxd.com/film/top-gun-maverick/), [Bullet Train](https://letterboxd.com/film/bullet-train/) (all saw in cinema). And [All Quiet on the Western Front](https://letterboxd.com/film/all-quiet-on-the-western-front-2022/), [Barbarian](https://letterboxd.com/film/barbarian-2022/), [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/), [Black Phone](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-black-phone/), [One Day](https://letterboxd.com/film/one-day-2011/), [The Banshees of Inisherin](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-banshees-of-inisherin/) & [Glass Onion](https://letterboxd.com/film/glass-onion-a-knives-out-mystery/).

[Trakt](https://trakt.tv/users/nikitavoloboev/) & [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/nikitavoloboev/) makes writing these overviews easy.

## Nice things I added

Started using [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) as my terminal. Together with [Fish Shell](../../unix/shell/fish.md).

Moved my [personal site](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/nikitavoloboev) to [Solid](../../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) and generally love everything about it now for building reactive UIs. Looks like this now but I plan to make many changes to it soon.

Use [Height](https://height.app/) now for all my project tracking. Although I do wish for Height like tool built on top of [GitHub](../../open-source/github/github.md) issues. Use Height to manage how I allocate time in terms of projects, [goals](../../focusing/goals.md), long term focuses.

Also discovered [Tauri](../../programming-languages/rust/rust-libraries/tauri.md). Still bad at [Rust](../../programming-languages/rust/rust.md) but for now it creates lightweight windows on the desktop which is what I care about.

The other big thing that truly started to pay dividends is moving my 2 [Twitter](../../tools/twitter.md) tabs with my main feed & my [secondary list](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1351120526220152839) into separate [Safari Technology Preview](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/) app. I then have `spacebar + k` binding to open it. It's nice separation as I use my main Safari window for only productive work. Solving my problems one by one.

I do still visit HN, Lobsters, GitHub etc. and I need to cut this time down massively. Reason I do is that a lot of that content gets indexed into this wiki and I fear it will be hard to retrieve it later especially from likes of Reddit, on HN, I can search/parse historical data. On GitHub too, I can write crawler for all stars/repos etc. that my following graph has and index it, compare to what's already in the database etc.

In any way, next year I hope this problem gets solved fully so I spend majority of the day actually fully solving problems instead of semi automated indexing. Although I do find it enjoyable as I can watch a video etc. in background as I do it. Plus I get many fancy ideas as I encounter new repos/articles etc.

I should be more mindful going forward in 2023. Still 27. [Not great, not terrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXUJ22fD4Cw).

Oh and next year I will stop doing mindless releasing everything I make for free to all. When you don't have enough money to pay for medicine and yet you clearly see quite a few people enjoy what you make is somewhat idiotic. üòø

More specifically I want to try experiment still keeping everything open source but still charging for addons with regards to user experience you can get. Open source to me at least is essential as I truly dislike not being able to change the software I use. I want full control over tools I run, especially ones I run often.

Oh and other thing I started doing is I researched what [skin care](../../health/skin-care.md) actually is. Difference between cleanser, moisturizer, serums. Why each one exists, what order to use etc. Settled on mostly products from [Geek & Gorgeous](https://geekandgorgeous.com/) and so far I love how it makes my skin feel.

Also researched more into [nutrition](../../health/nutrition/nutrition.md), [exercises](../../fitness/exercises.md). I was already mindful of not overdoing it on sugary drinks, chocolates and generally non natural foods.

I remember not liking avocados at some point when I first came to NL but now love them so much. True super food that's healthy and generally goes well with everything. Mostly I try start my dayes with omelette on bread with avocado, some sauce and tomatoes.

I also am trying to perfect that nutrient dense shake. It's actually not easy to make something that's tasty in such small quantity that I can drink. When I first found out about existence of shakes, I made shakes so thick it wasn't a drink, you had to actually eat whatever came from the blender. üò∫

Well, for now I did find this company, [Nuzest](https://www.nuzest.co.uk/) that seems to be doing nice blends for both [micro nutrient mixtures](https://www.nuzest.co.uk/products/good-green-vitality) and [plant proteins](https://www.nuzest.co.uk/products/clean-lean-protein). It's much cheaper than [Athletic Greens](https://athleticgreens.com/en) that's so heavily advertised by likes of [Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com) whose podcast I do enjoy.

I noted all my nutrition and supplement routine in [this wiki](../../health/nutrition/supplements.md). Most of it I will start after I will get my health issue in order via surgery, after I get the funds for it.

But yes other than that and the stupid war that's happening 2022 wasn't a bad year for me. I also spent a lot of time in Spain where my parents live together with my younger brother, sister and my 2 dogs and 3 cats. Love them all a lot. ‚ô•Ô∏è
