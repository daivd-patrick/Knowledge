# 2022

Happy I survived until this day. Majority of the year I spent with nearly 0 euro on my account. And with health issues I have no money to solve. üòø

My fault though. Should stop being so trash at computers. And be [more focused](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1601959862648582145). I know [Karabiner](../../macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md) well. I think I am fast. But not fast/smart/focused enough..

Thankful for the [few donations I get a month](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev). Keeps me going. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Trying to use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat#) to make and learn things faster. And hopefully releasing [LA](../../ideas/learn-anything.md) finally. All the health/finance issues I have is living life on hard mode.

I like the idea of setting [themes for next year](https://www.relay.fm/cortex/136). My theme given the mess that's my life where I can't afford a life critical surgery is a year of health, focused projects and financial stability.

Part of me dislikes complaining about how bad things are but another part thinks it's nice to be truthful. And perhaps if my life does get better next year, I get healthy again, I'll have something to look back on and remember that it can always get worse so appreciate what you have. Assuming things get better next year.

Oh and next year I want to go deep into [mushrooms](../../other/mushrooms.md) growing. I found plenty of books to read. Will study it hard, take many photos. My parents built a nice greenhouse in Spain that I plan to use. Was even thinking of building my own water sprinkler for fun. Write some embedded code, do the whole thing with wiring and tubes.

Also I did finally came to conclusion on which [stack I want to persue and go deep in exploring](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1606262383315492864).

It's also wild to think that this year in February a pointless bloody war was started still taking many lives. Not sure how I can help stop this sooner other than maybe earning more money and donating to Ukraine. Hope it ends soon and love wins over hate and stupidity.

Here is to better and healthier 2023. üéá
