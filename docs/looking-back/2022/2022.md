# 2022

Happy I survived until this day. Majority of the year I spent with nearly 0 euros on my account. And with health issues I have no money to solve. ðŸ˜¿

My fault though. Should stop being so trash at computers.

Thankful for the [few donations I get a month](https://github.com/sponsors/nikitavoloboev). Keeps me going.

Here is to better and healthier 2023.
