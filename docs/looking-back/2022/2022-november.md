# 2022 November

Came across [Dropcode](https://github.com/egoist/dropcode) and now I am thrilled. The stack of [Tauri](../../programming-languages/rust/rust-libraries/tauri.md) with [Solid](../../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) is perfection. I was looking into [Wails](../../programming-languages/go/go-libraries/wails.md) previously and had something working but Tauri seems to have a bigger team and support behind it. So time to learn rust.

Lots of drama with [Twitter](../../tools/twitter.md) being bought by Elon. Not sure how I feel about it as some strange decisions are being implemented but will see. Don't think Twitter will actually meanigfully lose users but some certainly are moving to [Mastodon](../../social-networks/mastodon.md) which is slowly getting better. 

Life been pretty hectic a lot and I find myself still unhappy about certain parts of my life even though it's a pain to give any emotion to my thoughts. Should learn to disengage and focus on what I love doing more. 

In any way, I haven't been watching anything much, just trying to learn, get my life more in order with [Height](https://height.app) and starting on the more scheduled updates weekly. Still have to build that good [habits](../../focusing/habits.md) app. [Streaks](https://streaksapp.com/) is not cutting it.

Also I knew this before but I am so bad at making interesting and aesthetic photos. Don't know how some are so good at it. Like all [photographers here](../../art/art.md#photography) are all incredibly good. Something about learning lighting and composition. And good editing. And actually taking **a lot** of photos should help.

Oh yeah, also started training daily. Just some bodyweight exercies, mainly dips and pull ups with leg raises. Just trying to train until exhaustion, maybe a few sets and that's it. Also need to eat a lot more. I am eating fairly healthy now with tea/water and eggs with fish mostly. No unnecessary sugar with my 3 [supplements](../../health/nutrition/supplements.md) of vegan omega 3, vitamin D3 and Magnesium.

Also love walking with my dogs, found a nice field nearby and usually stroll around there with some podcasts. One with [Andrej Karpathy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdiD-9MMpb0) was inspiring. Transformer ML models are super good and are being used and scaled by everyone in industry. Think they were first presented by [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) paper. Don't want to delve into ML yet though before I fix my essential skills of getting quick web apps and soon iOS apps. Once I learn that well with some more design practice, I can look into doing something with [generative ML models](../../machine-learning/generative-machine-learning.md). 

Also one thing I've been trying to do more and more of as can be seen by this rather longish look back compared to past ones is to just be myself and write more. I have a few entries for past months I wrote in [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/) as they were private to me. Journaling is very therapeutic. On private side I think my biggest stress if you can say that is just worrying about Rachel, who is my chocolate labrador who is 14 years old. She is amazing. And reading about how labradords who live up to 14 years old are an exception is not helping. So I try to spend as much time as I can with her. She actually gets sad when I leave so I try not do that. Thus all my time spending with my family in Spain. All's good though. Just need to write more code and learn.

Writing this out in [Obsidian](../../tools/obsidian.md), truly beautiful piece of software that I just wish was open source. Will see when I can build LA up to replace Obsidian as that is the goal in the end. For now I am happy this software exists. 

There's few people whose work I follow a lot of and just get so excited when they share something, I hope I become one of these people for someone. Here are some:

- [Alex MacCaw](https://twitter.com/maccaw) - Worked very briefly with him on [Reflect](https://reflect.app/) but lacked experience to continue. His work is outstanding and he is so pragmatic about building. Especially the focus of building out Reflect into a family kind of business instead of it being VC backed. Small team, big ambitions. Also he is kind of goals as far as life goes, can spend time in New York, can live on a boat. One day.
- [Victor Pontis](https://twitter.com/VictorPontis) - Amazing person from brief interaction I had with him. Worked briefly on [Glow Wallet](https://glow.xyz/). The team behind it is inspiring so as the tech and ambitions. Also [Luma](https://lu.ma/). Some software can be delightful and bring joy when you use it. Glow and Luma do just that. I think both tools have a lot of potential to change lives for better so I hope they grow more. I mean Meetup and Eventbrite look very outdated compared to Luma. I also hope to use Luma a bit once I start organizing events for LA. Need to do more things in real world instead of reading tweets and checking GitHub repos with occasional coding. ðŸ˜¸
- [Ryan Carniato](https://twitter.com/RyanCarniato) - Inspiring and actually life changing to me. I mean I liked a lot about React but Solid is just something different. All the best parts of React as far as DX goes but just writing Solid code you can get fast sites without much thinking about performance. I love love the component model and more recently [styled components in Solid](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-styled-components). Adding tailwind classes, when they get long gets kind of harder to read so its nice to just have clean component names with full power of CSS I can use instead of select classnames even if they cover many cases you'd expect to hit. In future want to get [Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/) working, perhaps with styled components. Basically write my CSS in TypeScript in place where I write the styles now in styled components. Would be nice I think. But yes, Ryan and actually the whole community over at [SolidJS Discord](https://discord.com/invite/solidjs) is lovely.
- [Vincent Ambo](https://github.com/tazjin) - Met him for first time at [NixCon](https://nixcon.org/). The things he is doing with Nix are super cool. Like [Nixery](https://github.com/tazjin/nixery) and the code in [Virus Lounge](https://tvl.fyi/) that holds code for [Tvix](https://tvl.fyi/blog/rewriting-nix). Want to understand Nix and Rust a lot more and use tools he built. 

Now that I started writing this list, I realize I can go for a long long time. One of the things I want to do as part of LA is a proper contacts handling. You can add contacts and share privately or publicly your notes on certain people, what you love about them. I think it can be nice.
