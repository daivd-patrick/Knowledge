# 2022 June

Met up with [Artem](https://agentcooper.io/about/) in Amsterdam, loved his passion for [biology](https://agentcooper.io/notes/biohack-academy/) and tech. [His journal](https://agentcooper.io/) is outstanding.

Making some progress on LA. Got new site up. Setup [Wails](https://github.com/wailsapp/wails) for the cross platform app. Setup the website. Setup the backend partly. Working on the CLI now.
