I'm living the sketch of being so broke where the [bank charges me money for being too broke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_-1l_SlA7c).

The monthly 127 I have to pay is mandated health insurance which I don't have money nor income for. ðŸ˜¿

I've learned to live frugally over past year. Only buy basics, just drink water. Learned to make nice fried eggs over this time. I learned the trick of dropping the egg on the pan itself as it's heating to save time. In few times I have money for avocado I love to make toasts too with the eggs. Cherish those moments.

I also am waiting for winter to end finally. I live in a house with my family and we don't have money for heating so it does get quite cold. Cold enough that you can't type properly on computers. Soon it will be over, I hope.

What's fascinating is that despite how bad things can get in life, it's still not enough to lose hope. I had my share of [depression](../../health/depression.md). Sometimes thinking I won't make it and would rather [die](../../life/death.md) than suffer more. But I've learned that giving up is the last thing you should do. You should always strive to get out of the hole you're in, no matter how difficult or lost it might feel.

On this note, I am trying my best to get new [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) deployed before I physically won't be able to do anything.

In other less depressive news, [The Last of Us](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-last-of-us) is a great show. The third episode was [touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTI4a4Da74o).
