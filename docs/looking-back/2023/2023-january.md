I'm living the sketch of being so broke where the [bank charges me money for being too broke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_-1l_SlA7c). YouTube premium was a luxury anyway. The saddest part is that I can't afford health insurance (mandated by NL) or food. Only food I eat are eggs with water and that's only because we actually have chickens at our house. I have no money for heating or electricity so it often gets extremely cold so it's hard to even type on the keyboard. ðŸ˜¿

Nor do I currently have any income to make those payments. I had my share of [depression](../../health/depression.md) in life. Sometimes thinking I won't make it and would rather [die](../../life/death.md) than suffer more. But I do have hope. Maybe things will get better.

I am trying my best to get [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) started. It's crazy to think you can still struggle so much in the year of supposed abundance. But oh well. I could be in jail or at war so not everything is as bad as it seems.

In other less depressive news, [The Last of Us](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-last-of-us) is a great show. The third episode was [too good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTI4a4Da74o).
