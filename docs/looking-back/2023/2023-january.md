I'm living the sketch of being so broke where the [bank charges me money for being too broke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_-1l_SlA7c). It might be funny too but I truly I can't afford health insurance (mandated by NL) or food. Only food I eat are eggs with water and that's only because we actually have chickens at our house that sometimes produce eggs. I have no money for heating or electricity so it often gets extremely cold and is hard to even type on the keyboard. ðŸ˜¿

Nor do I currently have any income to make any payments. I had my share of [depression](../../health/depression.md) in life. Sometimes thinking I won't make it and would rather [die](../../life/death.md) than suffer more. But I do have hope. Maybe things will get better.

I am trying my best to get [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything) started before I physically won't be able to do anything.

In other less depressive news, [The Last of Us](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-last-of-us) is a great show. The third episode was [touching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTI4a4Da74o).
