I'm living the sketch of being so broke where the [bank charges me money for being too broke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_-1l_SlA7c). YouTube premium was a luxury anyway. And I can't afford health insurance (mandated by NL) or food. Only food I eat are eggs with water.

In other news, [The Last of Us](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-last-of-us) is a great show.

And I started real work on [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything). Goal is to reach ramen profitability within next year. ðŸ˜»
