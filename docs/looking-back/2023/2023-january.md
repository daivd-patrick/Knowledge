I'm living the sketch of being so broke where the [bank charges me money for being too broke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_-1l_SlA7c). YouTube premium was a luxury anyway. And I can't afford health insurance (mandated by NL) or food. Only food I eat are eggs with water. Not to mention I have no money for heating or electricity so it's often hard to even type on my keyboard just due to how cold it gets. ðŸ˜¿

In other news, [The Last of Us](https://trakt.tv/shows/the-last-of-us) is a great show.

And I started real work on [LA](https://github.com/learn-anything/learn-anything). Goal is to be able to afford tasty food sometime within this or next year. And hopefully survive until summer. Dreams. ðŸ˜»

Jealousy is the mind killer.
