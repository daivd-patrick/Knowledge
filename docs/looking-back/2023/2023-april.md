# 2023 April

As mentioned in previous look back. Fired for 8th time. No money.

There is one positive about that though. I am free to build things I always wanted to build. Food/doctors can wait.

Only issue is tax I have to pay. Will most likely have to close this wiki + all my projects to just cover the money I owe the government.

> Just a start. Solid code can be so nice to work with.

Oh and I am 28 this month. ♥️

Want to be happy.
