# 2023 April

28 this month. Spending it Spain. Full focus on priority tasks/projects I need to complete in life.

Fuck everything else. Wrote out [routine](../../focusing/processes.md) for myself too:

## Morning

1. Wake up at ~ 9:00.
2. Go take dogs outside (listen to [podcasts](../../podcasts/podcasts.md)/[books](../../books/books.md) a bit)
3. Shower. Wash body + [skin care](../../health/skin-care.md) on face. [Brush teeth](../../health/teeth.md). Wear new clothes.
4. Give food to dogs + 2 pills for Rachel (put in bowl).
5. Make [tea](../../health/nutrition/drinks/tea.md) (big kettle)
6. 4 eggs + salad (tomatoes + avocado + feta + ..). [Optional smoothie](../../health/nutrition/supplements.md#smoothie).
7. Take [2 omega 3 pills + 1 magnesium](../../health/nutrition/supplements.md)
8. Twitter 2 feeds actively, snapshot github/lobsters/hn/reddit. (should be automated asap, have my own algorithm for surfacing useful to me things, removing noise)
9. Work through todos!

## Day

1. Take dogs on longer walk (podcast/book listen) at least once for ~ 1h.
2. Do some [exercise](../../fitness/exercises.md) outside (sit ups + push ups).
3. Put clothes to clean so there are always clean clothes available.
4. Keep [good back](../../health/ergonomics.md) (no slouch) and always work outside in terrace when you can.
5. Take notes on everything I learn and be productive and aggressive on completing todos! Share progress made / thoughts on Twitter.
6. Drink a lot of tea throughout the day. Always keep hydrated more than necessary.
7. No coffee + no sweets. Just eggs + salad + fish or healthy proteins.

## Evening

1. Walk dogs + podcast/book.
2. Give dogs food.
3. [Skin care](../health/skin-care.md) face + [brush teeth](../health/teeth.md). Clean myself.
4. Write / voice memo transcribe the day's progress & how I feel in look back.
5. Go to sleep. Always clean bed sheets.

Full transparency and no bullshit going forward.

Also want KusKus to cover the above case of following daily habits. Need to build iOS KusKus app which let me to send notifications at certain times of the day + show the list of habits and let me checkmark each habit as I do it.

I have some health issues too I am not comfortable sharing publicly but will need to earn enough money to fix them. So work, work, work!

Also I am still writing these look backs in Sublime Text / Obsidian. Hopefully maybe in June I will fully transfer it all to LA. Things like images for example are quite annoying to easily add, amongst other things.

Anyway, this quote in Fight Club comes to mind of how I feel in life right now.

> [Only After We've Lost Everything Are We Free To Do Anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzJOduVHxoQ)

I don't own or have much anything in life. I am 28, not too old to do meaningful things. But I do have bitter experience of what works and what doesn't. I especially know my vices and know what addictions and unconscious behavior I am prone to repeat. My goal is to fully augment / remove the ability to do self destructive or non meaningful things to myself with software.

p.s. I would rather die than write another look back where I complain about how life is unfair and how painful it is to survive.

It's pathetic and achieves nothing.

As I do take walks often now and listen to podcasts/books. I've always dreamed of having a podcast/book app that when you open it, you would see the full transcription of what was said. So you can highlight it and save it to your wiki. Right now if I come across something interesting, I have to pause the podcast/book, go to telegram saved messages and note it down. 

[HappyScribe](https://www.happyscribe.com/public) is similar to this idea but it doesn't do it live like for example Spotify does with lyrics. I want that. With ideally tight integration with LA in future. So I can tag a note or make an action on it into KusKus.

The future I envision and hope to get to asap is KusKus for todos fully. Todos private and public. Go on user's profile, see all their public todos which are basically ideas to build. Explore page in KusKus surfaces interesting todos ala Twitter/TikTok Explore page.

Then on LA side, all knowledge mapped. Sorted by topics. Track topics to learn / learned. Generate study guides by AI with help of community. Fully automate getting to the stage where any idea can be built. Fully automate finding ideas to build. 

In future, perhaps synthesize new ideas based on all kinds of things. 

All of the above is kind of possible now in some way or form. But it's all so so messy. I want clean interfaces to creating, learning things. 

## KusKus

Making progress. Plan to release it this month in April.
