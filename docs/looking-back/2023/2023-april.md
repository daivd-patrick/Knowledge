# 2023 April

As mentioned in previous look back. Fired for 8th time. No money. 

There is one positive about that though. I am free to build things I always wanted to build. Food/doctors can wait.

> Just a start. Solid code can be so nice to work with.

Oh and I am 28 this month. ♥️

Want to be happy.
