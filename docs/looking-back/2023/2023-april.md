# 2023 April

28 this month. Spending it Spain. Full focus on priority tasks/projects I need to complete in life.

Fuck everything else. Wrote out routine for myself too:

## Routine

morning: ~ 9:00 wake up

1. take dogs outside (listen to podcast a bit)
2. shower / wash + skin care on face / new clothes
3. give food to dogs + 2 pills for Rachel (put in bowl)
4. make tea (big kettle)
5. 4 eggs + salad (tomatoes + avocado + feta + ..)
6. take 2 omega 3 pills + 1 magnesium
7. twitter 2 feeds actively, snapshot github/lobsters/hn (automate asap)
8. work through todo!

day:

1. take dogs on longer walk (podcast listen) at least once for ~ 1h
2. do some exercise outside (sit ups + push ups)
3. put clothes to clean so there are always clean clothes available
4. keep good back (no slouch) and always work outside in terrace when you can
5. take notes on everything I learn and be productive and aggressive on completing todos! share progress made / thoughts on twitter
6. drink a lot of tea throughout the day. always keep hydrated more than necessary.
7. no coffee + no sweets. just eggs + salad + fish or healthy proteins

evening:

1. walk dogs + podcast
2. give dogs food
3. skin care face + brush teeth + clean myself
4. go to sleep

Full transparency and no bullshit going forward.

Also want KusKus to cover the above case of following daily habits. Need to build iOS KusKus app which let me to send notifications at certain times of the day + show the list of habits and let me checkmark each habit as I do it.

I have some health issues too I am not comfortable sharing publicly but will need to earn enough money to fix them. So work, work, work!

Also I am still writing these look backs in Sublime Text / Obsidian. Hopefully maybe in June I will fully transfer it all to LA. Things like images for example are quite annoying to easily add, amongst other things.

Anyway, this quote in Fight Club comes to mind of how I feel in life right now.

> [Only After We've Lost Everything Are We Free To Do Anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzJOduVHxoQ)

I don't own or have much anything in life. I am 28, not too old to do meaningful things. But I do have bitter experience of what works and what doesn't. I especially know my vices and know what addictions and unconscious behavior I am prone to repeat. My goal is to fully augment / remove the ability to do self destructive or non meaningful things to myself with software.

## KusKus

Making progress. Plan to release it this month in April.
