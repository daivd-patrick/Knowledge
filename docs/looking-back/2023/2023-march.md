Bank account check.

Just want to die honestly. I am useless. Can't do anything. ðŸ˜¿

Didn't pass my first contract I had with [Inlang](https://inlang.com/). It's great company/team but too smart for me.

My job was supposed to be to take over the Git SDK. Wrote up [RFC for the future of Git SDK](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/pull/455) too. But turns out it was not a fit.

In any way. Not my first time with being rejected. My whole life is a [series of failures](../../health/depression.md) and trying to survive on little food.

I did actually sit down and try code all day this last month. With barely no breaks. Actually with help of [ChatGPT](../../machine-learning/chatgpt.md), things like reimplementing or extending [Git in JS](https://github.com/isomorphic-git/isomorphic-git) suddenly start to seem approachable. I don't read news as much and generally am more focused. Just life is really too hard recently.

I have been in survival mode for the past 6 years it seems. From job to job. Barely making enough to make rent or food. Rejection after rejection. I've been fired 8 times now for now being good enough. I've been told that I should just go back to school and I will **never** become a programmer with my brain.

It truly seems daunting and sometimes I just want to give up.

In any way, aside from above, nothing else happened this month. Just never ending grind to live.
