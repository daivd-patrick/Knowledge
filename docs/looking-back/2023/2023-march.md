# 2023 March

28 in a month. Can't afford food. Got [fired for 8th time](../../health/depression.md) this month.

Worked for a total of 3 weeks at [Inlang](https://inlang.com/). It's great company/team but too smart for me. As always.

My job was supposed to be to take over the Git SDK. Wrote up my first up [RFC on choosing between libgit2 and isomorphic-git for Git SDK](https://github.com/inlang/inlang/pull/455). Great experience and will do RFCs for bigger decisions in all my projects going forward I think.

In any way, not first time living with 0 on my bank account, not being able to afford to pay tax or food.

I remember on the 2nd job I ever got, when I got fired, the CEO talked to me personally. He said I should go back to school and programming is not for me. I should reconsider this profession and choose something else. Was an interesting walk from his office afterwards.

That was the 2nd time. I got fired/rejected so many times after that time, I lost count. Maybe I am crazy to ever consider writing code again but who knows, maybe something comes of it.

With respect to Inlang, although only 3 weeks, I learned a lot. It was my first ever opportunity to work on an open source project and actually get paid. I love the team there and the vision to build git based apps. It's built with Solid and has some nice code I will in the least use in my future projects. Specifically the way the editor loads and sets the state when the page gets rendered.

They also use Discord for all communication, have nice channels. The textual checkins were great. I worked in companies that did morning video checkins and thought it was unnecessary. Textual checkins are perfect enough honestly.

If I wasn't as bad of a programmer, it'd be a dreamy place to work at for sure. But alas.

The maybe sad thing is that I did actually try these 3 weeks. I coded all day with only few breaks to talk with my partner or take a walk. Used [ChatGPT](../../machine-learning/chatgpt.md) for coding/learning and absolutely loved it. I actually understand Git on a deeper level now. Files are hashed. Commits are hashes of the hashed committed files. Branches are hashes of commits. [Hashes all the way down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ig5E8CcdM9g).

## Watched

I did get to watch [Scenes from a Marriage](https://trakt.tv/shows/scenes-from-a-marriage-2021) with my partner and loved it. It reaffirmed to me that most issues in relationships stem from miscommunication or lack of it. Also showed well how being hurt really bad once by someone closes you of to ever be fragile again with that person.

## Listened

[We Came And Left](https://open.spotify.com/track/2bKVbvI4F0FktcUXrQ9vIe) is great little tune. And [Cloud Forest](https://open.spotify.com/track/3gQAt3Q8pakB2nkRX4CzJp).

Most of the songs I listen to now are instrumental.

## Retro

Will be doing retros as part of look backs from now on. I am not a good programmer in any way. I am fast on the mac but not as smart. I can't solve problems as fast and it's okay.

Rejections don't phase me any more. After the things I've been told or experienced it would be a shame to start to get affected by these things.

The only thing I want is to in the least be able to afford to pay tax or buy food. And for that as I have no job now, I need to build. And build fast.

I need to reconsider how I do open source. It's not sustainable in any way. I earn 0 from everything I've uploaded to GitHub. I don't think the value of things I've shared is 0 though.

For next month, the goal is to build a todo app I always wanted to build. There's many todo apps. But this one will be different. It even has a name, KusKus.

The app will have hotkeys similar to [2Do](../../macOS/apps/2do.md). Will have integration with GitHub issues similar to now dead [Ship](https://www.realartists.com/blog/ship-20.html). And it will be AI integrated.

For example, you write a task, press a hotkey and GPT will create subtasks for you. There will be live collaboration, nice design and one killer feature for why I currently use [Obsidian](../../tools/obsidian.md).

You can write todos into a text area with vim bindings. Just write things and indent as if it's a text file. And with hotkey, it will turn the text area into actual todos with due dates and all. [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com/) is similar to this in style.

Essentially I want to build a todo app I always wanted to exist.

The todo app and [LA](../../ideas/learn-anything.md). 2 projects that will take all my time.

I also want to build my own [ChatGPT](../../machine-learning/chatgpt.md) app. I now use [this tauri desktop wrapper](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT). It's nice. But I want ability to pipe results into GPT from selected text with pre prompts. And I want to build a better service for sharing GPT prompts than the existing [ShareGPT](https://sharegpt.com/).

I honestly reached a point where I truly don't care about even outcomes. I set [goals](../../focusing/goals.md) and I try reach them. And I fail and fail until I reach them.

Will be using [Solid](../../programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/solid.md) + [Grafbase](../../networking/graphql/grafbase.md) to build things out. Also [Ark](https://github.com/chakra-ui/ark) seems nice for UI.

Coming back to Spain this month to see my family and üê∂. Love them a lot.

No matter what happens. It will be okay. And with the way GPT models and all are progressing it seems nothing we do matters as much as we thought unless it directly contributes to reaching AGI anyway. So why worry.

One other thing that did worry me a bit and maybe still does. Is just how unfair life is. I am quite lucky in many many ways. But still. To be a programmer in USA is just so unfair compared to anywhere else. And I can't move to USA because I don't have a degree or money to even visit it. Anyway. There's more to [happiness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9dZQelULDk) than success.
