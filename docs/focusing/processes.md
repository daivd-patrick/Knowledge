# Processes

Good processes are essential for any kind of repeated [success](../life/success.md). Below are some personal processes I try follow for myself when doing certain things. 

I think of my [rules](rules.md) as boundaries within I try to operate my life. And processes are series of steps I should take when doing certain things. Some are vaguer than others. If I do them enough times, they become part of my [habits](habits.md).

## Morning

1. Wake up. Go take shower. 
2. Do [morning skin care routine](../health/skin-care.md).
3. Morning [exercise](../fitness/exercises.md). Until exhaustion: push ups, deep squats & downward dog to cobra pose. Do exercise outside as I walk my dog, when I am around her. Listen to [podcast](../podcasts/podcasts.md) during it.
4. No [news](../research/staying-on-top-of-things.md) (Twitter/HN/..) until I do sabove.
5. Start day by checking my task manager for the day. Have timed 40 min to check Twitter/HN, reply to messages etc.
6. Start work.

## Evening

1. Do [evening skin care routine](../health/skin-care.md).
2. Evening [exercise](../fitness/exercises.md). Until exhaustion: deep squats. Listen to some soothing music and think of plans for tomorrow or podcast.
3. Write in [look back](../looking-back/looking-back.md) & review of habits + check on [plans](goals.md).
4. Some light [news](../research/staying-on-top-of-things.md) or book reading (book preferred).
5. Sleep. I try to not expose myself to blue light during evening and be thoroughly exhausted at this point from good day's work.
