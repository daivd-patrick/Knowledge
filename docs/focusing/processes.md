# Processes

Good processes are essential for any kind of repeated [success](../life/success.md). Below are some personal processes I try follow for myself when doing certain things. 

I think of my [rules](rules.md) as boundaries within I try to operate my life. And processes are series of steps I should take when doing certain things. Some are vaguer than others. If I do them enough times, they become part of my [habits](habits.md).
