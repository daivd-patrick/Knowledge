# Everything I know

Page of things I consider myself knowledgeable of. Similar in spirit to [Dan's post on things he doesn't know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/).

- [Karabiner](macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md): How to bind keys on mac.
- [macOS](macOS/macOS.md): How to operate it very fast. Especially with apps like [KM](../macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro.md), [Alfred](macOS/apps/alfred/alfred.md), [VSCode](text-editors/vs-code/vs-code.md).
- [React](programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/react/react.md): Love it for building user interfaces.
- Optimizing [my workflow](my-workflow.md): I think I'm pretty good at it as I have this quirk where I get annoyed by littlest of things and want to automate everything away.

## To learn

My goals with learning more broadly is curiosity in finding [universe](../space/universe.md)'s [physics rules](physics/physics.md) and ability to create any [idea](ideas/ideas.md) I care a lot about come alive. Fast and efficiently.

> Everything within the realm of physics is possible

And a lot is possible given this limitation. Human imagination is wild.
