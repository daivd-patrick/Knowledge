# Everything I know

Page of things I consider myself knowledgeable of. Similar in spirit to [Dan's post on things he doesn't know](https://overreacted.io/things-i-dont-know-as-of-2018/).

- [Karabiner](macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner.md): How to bind keys on mac.
- [macOS](macOS/macOS.md): How to operate it very fast. Especially with apps like [KM](../macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/keyboard-maestro.md), [Alfred](macOS/apps/alfred/alfred.md), [VSCode](text-editors/vs-code/vs-code.md).
- [React](programming-languages/javascript/js-libraries/react/react.md): Love it for building user interfaces.

## My Workflow

I list all the tools and my approaches to life & solving problems [here](my-workflow.md). It's constantly updating. I try to automate all the annoying things I encounter.

## Learning now

What I'm learning now can be found in [Notion Goals board](https://www.notion.so/e462537d8f3d40c095ea67091ca91f45?v=1006717e984a4243b198bcad5bf05198).

Choosing what to learn is ideally due to making some [idea](ideas/ideas.md) I am excited about come alive.

Or I am curious about something and want to explore. Lately it's been:

- [physics](../physics/physics.md)
- [type theory](../math/type-theory/type-theory.md)
