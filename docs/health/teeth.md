Use [Marvis Classic Mint Toothpaste](https://www.sixandsons.com/products/marvis-toothpaste-classic-mint-25ml) with [Sonicare 9900 Prestige Toothbrush](https://www.philips.co.uk/c-e/pe/electric-toothbrushes/sonicare/prestige-9900.html#!).

## Notes

- [As long as a toothpaste has fluoride and is non abrasive and you don't have some unusual need like sensitivity or SLS issues, toothpastes are pretty much all the same.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/3hkwok/your_thoughts_of_marvis_toothpaste/)
