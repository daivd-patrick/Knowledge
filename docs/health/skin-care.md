# Skin care

Based of [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xv0ISHGGw1A), it said there are 3 proven ways to improve your skin:

1. Moisturizer
2. Sun screen
3. [Retinol product](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEB5qSTcHck)

Thus, my skin care routine is, in morning:

1. [Prep] Wash my face with water.
2. [Moisturizer] Apply [Pyunkang Yul Nutrition Cream](https://pyunkangyul.us/products/nutrition-cream-100ml). Let it absorb.
3. [Sun screen] Apply [Isntree Hyaluronic Acid Watery Sun Gel](https://koreanskincare.nl/products/hyaluronic-acid-watery-sun-gel-spf50-pa). Let it absorb.

In evening, before sleep:

1. [Prep] Wash my face with water.
2. [Retinol] Apply [Retinol Serum](https://www.kiehls.com/skincare/face-serums/micro-dose-anti-aging-retinol-serum-with-ceramides-and-peptide/WW0154KIE.html). Let it absorb.
3. Go to sleep, always use fresh sheets especially on the pillows.

During the day, I try not to touch my face with dirty hands. I also try be as relaxed as I can be no matter the situation. Relaxed face without any frowning.

At night, I try to sleep [either my back or side](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleeping-positions). Although I do fall as asleep fastest when sleeping on my stomach. Unfortunately, sleeping on your stomach, can cause wrinkles to form.

I shower after any exercise I do. And do shower at least once a day, usually in mornings.

Sometimes I apply [Nutrition cream](https://pyunkangyul.us/products/nutrition-cream-100ml) but it's [not necessary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3aIeABbNvY) given routine I have above.

I sadly have a bunch of deep scars I got from having severe acne when I was young. Trying to fix it up with [microneedling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPWycy8cwN8).

Found [exercising](../fitness/exercises.md) often, good [sleep](../sleep/sleep.md) and clean [wholefoods plant based diet](nutrition/nutrition.md) to have noticeable effect on the skin too, especially its healthy color.

[Skin Care Addiction subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/) is insightful.

- [Research has shown that order of application doesn’t matter as much as people think, except for sunscreen usage. Sun screen should be applied about 10 minutes before sun exposure. That includes prolonged exposure by windows, which most of the time do not filter UVA rays. The 10 minute window allows the sunscreen to set on your skin and create a protective barrier, even though the active ingredients are functional upon application. It should also be the last thing you apply before makeup if applicable, to disturb the barrier as little as possible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/ebhfgg/product_question_pyunkang_yul_moisture_ampoule/)
