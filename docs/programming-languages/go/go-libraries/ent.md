# [Ent](https://github.com/ent/ent)

My preferred ORM for [Go](../go.md).

Doing [tutorial](https://entgo.io/docs/tutorial-setup) as it shows how to write [the code](https://github.com/a8m/ent-graphql-example) for setting up a [GraphQL](../../../networking/graphql/graphql.md) instance is great intro.
