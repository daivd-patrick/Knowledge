# [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

[Elysia](https://github.com/elysiajs/elysia) is nice web framework.

Currently using [Deno](../../web/deno.md) as my primary way to write [TS](../typescript/typescript.md).

I use Bun to make sure I don't have to write [Node](../../web/nodejs/nodejs.md) as it's simply faster version of Node with lots of nice life improvements and faster development cycle.
