# [Cannabis](https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Cannabis)

Use [Mighty+](https://www.storz-bickel.com/en-us/mighty-plus) when I occasionally use weed, goes especially well with [psychedelics](psychedelics/psychedelics.md). I start vape at 180. After few minutes, I gradually increase it 200 and end sessions at 210-220C until no smoke comes out. Huberman did nice [episode on effects of cannabis](https://hubermanlab.com/the-effects-of-cannabis-marijuana-on-the-brain-and-body/).

Mostly I can't see any noticeable difference between any strains I vape. I prefer more [psychedelic](psychedelics/psychedelics.md) effect. And only way to get it is to grow your own strains or get some from [Boerejongens](https://www.boerejongens.com/) if you're in [NL](../travel/visited/netherlands.md) as most/all coffee shops there sell overpriced bad weed due to silly laws. Heard that's different in [US](../travel/visited/united-states.md).

I actually came to get interested in psychedelics after 2nd time I smoked weed (purple haze). And for first time in my life had my reality warp like I never saw before. Read about all kinds of [drugs](drugs.md) and effects after that 2nd time.

Mostly now I don't get much psychedelic effect (things moving) but do get enjoyable high with interesting thought patterns.

[Sensi Seeds](https://sensiseeds.com/en/) has great seeds.

## Notes

- [The things you are doing aren’t because of cannabis. I can do those things sober. It’s the surrendering that’s doing it. It’s the being still, silent and surrendering. You are pulling your consciousness away from the world and into your own awareness and body. Cannabis puts the feedback of your consciousness on blast so it’s easier to do, but in no way do you need it. It’s just things are more subtle when you are sober.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/8bdt36/how_to_use_cannabis_as_a_very_potent_psychedelic/)
  - The thing so many people don’t realize about astral projection or deep states of consciousness is that it requires subtlety, immense subtlety. Cannabis helps that by amplifying the feedback so you can navigate your own consciousness easier.
- [Cannabis stimulates the Default Mode Network, specifically the sub-cortical amygdala. It works on the conscious brain. Mushrooms quiet the DMN, like meditation does. It works on the subconscious brain. I personally do not like to combine them, as they work in opposition to each other.](https://www.reddit.com/r/RationalPsychonaut/comments/ozt4k5/thc_and_psilocybin_and_their_effects_on_thinking/)
