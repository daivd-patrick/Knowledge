# GitHub

I ðŸ’š GitHub. It is really one of the best communities out there that exists with so many different projects and ideas being worked on at any given time.

I publish most of my work and make it open source for other people to use and reuse and I build my own system to how I can be productive using the GitHub website and all the tooling and services it provides.

# Issues

For managing issues I have, I use [Ship macOS app][1].

I assign a time frame to each issue, either `working on` or `soon`. 

Ship app also allows you to put certain issues into Up Next group as can be seen below : 

TODO: 

And then I can filter through these issues.
