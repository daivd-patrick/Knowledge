# Functional programming
## Notes
- [A monad is an abstraction that can be used to parametrize code with the way how computations are sequenced. A monad can also be seen as design pattern, that sometimes makes your code more readable (and, more often, less readable).](https://binaryanalysisplatform.github.io/bap/api/master/Monads.Std.html)
- Think of monads as of codification of imperative effectful computations in a more general way.
