# Programming
I am not a great programmer by any means but the few programs I did write solved the small problems I had. I hope to solve even bigger problems with time.

## Notes
- In software engineering there are two things you are trying to get right:
	- Software Validation - Did we build the right thing?
	- Software Verification - Did we build the thing right?
- Software simplicity is a prerequisite to reliability.
- A small, simple API is usually also a hallmark of a well-understood problem.
- Run/Right/Fast.
	- Make the code work I write is working. Then I can make it fast (if necessary). Solving the “correct/clean/performant code” problem all at once can be overwhelming. Don’t be overwhelmed. Solve one at a time.
- Reducing the maintenance burden is, for most codebases, the biggest optimization I can do.
	- Of course it's all about striking a balance, but 99% of the time there is a choice between performance and readability, readability is the right answer. Performance should only be chosen if it is absolutely necessary.
- If I write ugly code, anyone who intends to fix a bug or add a feature will not enjoy his work and likely avoid it next time.
- Explicit over implicit is almost always better.
