# Git
I love Git and version control. And I use version control over any project I do.

## Notes
- Commit as often as you can. Ideally after each micro-iteration, when something new is working.
	- This way, at the end of the day you can just rebase the whole branch and squash all of the micro-commits in a whole commit implementing the whole new features.
