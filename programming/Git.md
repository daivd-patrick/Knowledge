# Git
I love git and version control. And I use version control over any project I do.

I often like to use emojis for some git commits. But only for few specific ones and usually the emoji insertions are automated. 

I quite often commit all changes with ✨with [this alias](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles#commit-all-with-). Sometimes I just want to commit a change and a commit message is unnecessary so it saves time. I don't do it when writing code.
