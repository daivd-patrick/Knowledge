# State machines

## Notes

- [When should you use XState? When you have something complex to build, with: 1. Many side effects, especially long-running ones like call recording. 2. Sequences of things that MUST happen in a certain order (choose devices, record, preview). Either dead simple (useState) or everything else (XState).](https://twitter.com/mpocock1/status/1451486390911373314)
- [I use XState anytime I have to write my own useState and it is more than a single boolean per component, or anytime I'd use useEffect.](https://twitter.com/triangulo_dev/status/1451533181329547304)
