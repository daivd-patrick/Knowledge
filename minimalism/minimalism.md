# Minimalism
I love to live minimally and only use what I really need. Think about things that matter to me. Cutting out the noise and focusing on what's important to me. I love cutting out any kind of distractions from my life. I love not keeping everything in my head and letting software and tools do the things they are good at. Storing and retrieving information. Events, todos, tasks and projects.

I try to focus on one task a time. Finished the task? Do the next one in the queue. Task too difficult? [Slice it and break it down to smaller tasks I can work on](../research/solving-problems.md). One by one. No extra thinking of whether I am doing the right thing right now or whether I should be focusing my time on something else perhaps. Full focus on the task at hand until it is done.

I practice this art of minimising and focusing on what's important to me & removing everything that is not with every single day.
