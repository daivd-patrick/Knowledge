# iOS
My favourite mobile operating system mostly due to me not really trying anything else. 

I wrote how I view and use iOS in quite a bit of detail [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios) alongside all the different apps I use on it.

I hope to release Learn Anything on iOS soon too. That would be quite cool.

# Notes
- [giving location, camera, photo permissions to apps matters](https://krausefx.com/blog/ios-privacy-watchuser-access-both-iphone-cameras-any-time-your-app-is-running)
