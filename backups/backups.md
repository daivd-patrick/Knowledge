# Backups
Using [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com) to make encrypted backups to [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/). I also keep encrypted Time Machine backup.

I love the fact that I can set up any new machine or phone to use my `exact` and perfect setup without any cruft in seconds.

## Backup tools
- [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) - Fast, secure, efficient backup program.
- [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) - Automatically backs up Macs and Windows PCs.

## Notes
- Even the smallest file can take days to recreate.
