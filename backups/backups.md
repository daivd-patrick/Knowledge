# Backups

Currently only use encrypted Time Machine backups.

But in future, I plan to start using [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com) to make encrypted backups to [Amazon Glacier](https://www.backblaze.com/) in addition to Time Machine.

I love the fact that I can set up any new machine or phone to use my `exact` and perfect setup without any cruft in seconds.

## Backup tools

- [Restic](https://github.com/restic/restic) - Fast, secure, efficient backup program.
- [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) - Automatically backs up Macs and Windows PCs.

## Notes

- Data that is not backed up is lost data.
- Even the smallest file can take days to recreate.

## Links

- [Tao backup](http://taobackup.com/) - Pretty funny take on backups.
