<h1 align="center"> Description 📕</h1>

Inspired by [this](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/knowledge). I want to keep my own version of a knowledge index that both I and other people interested can search over and use.

Unlike [my mind maps](https://my.mindnode.com/myLVaRLKytoTYBLshxGzzb75MN9cyGHbQBgaVVPp#179.9,-50.7,1) and [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) that searches over these mind maps. I want this to be a more official knowledge index and a reference for things I know that I find useful to reference back to.

My focus at current time is learning Programming, macOS automation with JXA, Alfred and Keyboard Maestro and scripting.
