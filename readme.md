<h1 align="center">My Knowledge Index üí°</h1>

<h1 align="center"> Description üìï</h1>

Inspired by [this](https://yoshuawuyts.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/). I want to keep my own version of a knowledge index that both I and other people can search over and use.

Unlike [my mind maps](https://my.mindnode.com/myLVaRLKytoTYBLshxGzzb75MN9cyGHbQBgaVVPp#179.9,-50.7,1) and [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) that searches over these mind maps. I want this to be a more official knowledge index and a reference for things I know that I find useful to reference back to.

<h1 align="center"> Using the Search Well üîç</h1>

In the left corner you can make searches for what content I have already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

Aside from this, you can of course also explore [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) for things that you can learn about and I will often reference it from these notes.

<h1 align="center"> Abbreviations üîñ</h1>

I will be using certain abbreviations for things that I may be repeating often. Here is what they mean : 

- LA = [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) (will often link to a map there for learning some topic)

<h1 align="center"> Other things I wrote and shared üìö</h1>

I share my knowledge in a longer form by [writing articles](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) and making [YouTube videos](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-youtube).

And you can also explore [my personal mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/myLVaRLKytoTYBLshxGzzb75MN9cyGHbQBgaVVPp#666.6,-32.8,-3) that I use for my own personal productivity and research. It is of course a bit more chaotic than these notes as its made for my own personal use.

But you can use [this Alfred workflow](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) to easily search through my entire knowledge base and essentially my whole world.

I also am in the process of writing a book on macOS automation that you will soon be able to read for free [here](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/macos-automation-guide/content/).

You can also see more repositories and books similar to this one [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge). And don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
