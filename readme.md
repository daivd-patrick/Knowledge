<h1 align="center">My Knowledge Index üí°</h1>

<h1 align="center"> Description üìï</h1>

Inspired by [this](https://yoshuawuyts.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/). I want to keep [my own version of a knowledge index](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/) that both I and other people can search over and use.

Unlike [my mind maps](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/meta/my-mind.html) and [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) that searches over these mind maps. I want this to be a more official knowledge index and a reference for things I know that I find useful to reference back to.

<h1 align="center"> Using the Search Well üîç</h1>

In the left corner you can make searches for what content I have already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](https://nikitavoloboev.gitbooks.io/knowledge/content/meta/meta.html) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals in a lot of detail.

Aside from this, you can of course also explore [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) for things that you can learn about and I will often reference it from these notes.

<h1 align="center"> Other things I wrote and shared üìö</h1>

I share my knowledge in a longer form by [writing articles](https://medium.com/@NikitaVoloboev) and making [YouTube videos](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-youtube).

I also love writing code that solves various problems I have and I share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev). [Here](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) you can find the things I have made and shared thus far.

Finally, you can explore [my personal mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/myLVaRLKytoTYBLshxGzzb75MN9cyGHbQBgaVVPp#1004.6,-1.7,-2) that I use for my own personal productivity and research. 

And you can see more repositories and books similar to this one [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge). 

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.
