# [My Knowledge Wiki ðŸ“š](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz)
This is my personal wiki where I share everything I know about this world in form of an [online GitBook](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz).

If this is your first time visiting this wiki, take a look [here](meta/meta.md) as it describes this wiki, its structure and goals in a lot of detail.

## Using the Wiki Well
In the left corner you can make searches for what content I have already indexed or you can simply explore the tree view to the left.

Aside from this, you can also explore [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz) for things that you can learn about and I will often reference it from these notes.

You can access any entry from this wiki super fast using my [Alfred My Mind](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/alfred-my-mind) workflow which alongside this wiki here, also searches through [various mind maps I've made](./meta/my-mind.md).

## Other things I wrote and shared
I share my knowledge in a longer form by [writing articles](sharing/my-articles) and making [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEKqrUfr_FMKIO9XSJS4vDw).

I also love writing code that solves various problems I have and I share it all on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev). [Here](http://nikitavoloboev.xyz/projects/) you can find the things I have made and shared thus far.

For more things I have shared, you can look [here](./sharing/sharing.md).

## Make your own wiki
You can view other similar to this, continuously updated wikis, [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/meta-knowledge).

Don't be afraid to create one of your own and share what you know with the world.

## Contributing
If you found a mistake anywhere in this wiki, I would really appreciate your help. You can quickly find any entry you wish to edit by searching for the topic [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/find/master) and then making the changes.

I also appreciate any [ideas you have](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge/issues/new) on how I can improve this wiki.
